# Demo Account Creation Instructions

Since Supabase Auth requires email confirmation, these accounts need to be created manually through the Supabase dashboard or directly in the database.

## 3 Demo Accounts Required

  - Register dancers for their studio

### 2. Competition Director Account
- **Email**: `director@compportal.test`

## SQL to Update Roles After Account Creation

After creating these accounts in Supabase Auth dashboard, run this SQL to set their roles:

```sql
-- Update studio director role
UPDATE public.user_profiles
SET role = 'studio_director'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'studio@compportal.test');

-- Update competition director role
UPDATE public.user_profiles
SET role = 'competition_director'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'director@compportal.test');

-- Update super admin role
UPDATE public.user_profiles
SET role = 'super_admin'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@compportal.test');
```

## Creating Accounts in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cafugvuaatsgihrsmvvl/auth/users
2. Click "Add user" â†’ "Create new user"
3. Enter email and password
4. Check "Auto Confirm User" to skip email verification
5. Create user
6. Run the SQL above to assign roles

## Alternative: Direct SQL Insert (Advanced)

This bypasses Supabase Auth UI but requires password hashing:

```sql
-- This is a template - you'll need to generate proper password hashes
-- Use Supabase dashboard instead for simplicity
```
