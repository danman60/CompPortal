## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short Term (This Session)

1. **Focus on P0 bugs only** - Get core functionality working
2. **Fix bugs #1 and #4 first** - These block all testing
3. **Test fixes immediately** - Verify each fix before moving to next
4. **Don't add new features** - Stability over features

### Medium Term (Before Launch)

1. **Complete full test suite** - Run all 50+ tests
2. **Add automated tests** - Prevent regressions
3. **User acceptance testing** - Get real studio feedback
4. **Performance testing** - Verify under load

### Long Term (Post-Launch)

1. **Monitor error logs** - Watch for production issues
2. **Gather user feedback** - Track pain points
3. **Prioritize fixes** - Based on impact and frequency

## üéØ LAUNCH READINESS ASSESSMENT

**Current Status:** ‚ùå **NOT READY**

**Blocking Issues:** 2 P0 critical bugs
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Estimated Re-test Time:** 4-6 hours
**Earliest Launch:** After fixes + full re-test (6-9 hours total)

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT LAUNCH** until P0 bugs fixed and re-tested
