# Email Notification Debugging Status

**Date:** 2025-10-24 2:10pm EST
**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED - Mutation not executing despite correct page usage

---

## Problem Summary

User approves reservations on `/dashboard/reservation-pipeline` in incognito browser, but:
- ‚ùå NO entries in `email_logs` table
- ‚ùå NO entries in `activity_logs` for `reservation.approve` action
- ‚úÖ Reservations DO get `status='approved'` in database
- ‚úÖ User is on correct page: `https://www.compsync.net/dashboard/reservation-pipeline`

**Conclusion:** The `trpc.reservation.approve` mutation is NOT being called, despite using the correct UI.

## Code Fixes Applied (All Committed)

### 1. Added templateType Parameters (Commit 4339ad7)
Fixed 9 critical email calls to include `templateType`, `studioId`, `competitionId`:
- `reservation.ts:537` - reservation submitted ‚Üí CD
- `reservation.ts:746` - reservation approved ‚Üí SD
- `reservation.ts:856` - reservation rejected ‚Üí SD
- `reservation.ts:1074` - payment confirmed ‚Üí SD
- `entry.ts:249` - routine summary submitted ‚Üí CD
- `entry.ts:883` - entry submitted ‚Üí SD
- `invoice.ts:715` - invoice delivery ‚Üí SD
- `invoice.ts:840` - payment confirmed ‚Üí SD
- `studio.ts:240` - studio profile submitted ‚Üí CD

### 2. Created Missing email_preferences Table (Commit 815b405)
- Created table with RLS policies
- Added email_type enum with all 9 notification types
- Unique constraint on (user_id, email_type)

### 3. Added Debug Logging (Commit eebda43)
Added console.log statements throughout approval flow in `reservation.ts`:
- Line 720: Email flow start
- Line 734: Studio owner check result
- Line 739: Email preference check result
- Line 756: About to send email
- Line 770: Email send result
- Lines 772, 775, 783: Failure paths

## Diagnostic Evidence

### Database Queries Show:

**Approved Reservations Exist:**
```sql
SELECT id, status, updated_at
FROM reservations
WHERE status = 'approved'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```
Result: 3 recent approvals (latest: `13:53:50`)

**NO Activity Logs:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM activity_logs
WHERE action = 'reservation.approve';
```
Result: EMPTY ‚ùå

**NO Email Logs:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_logs;
```
Result: EMPTY ‚ùå

**email_preferences Table Exists:**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name = 'email_preferences';
```
Result: EXISTS ‚úÖ

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. Frontend Not Using tRPC Mutation
The `ReservationPipeline.tsx` component HAS the mutation defined:
```typescript
// Line 52
const approveMutation = trpc.reservation.approve.useMutation({...});

// Line 211
approveMutation.mutate({ id: reservation.id, spacesConfirmed });
```

**But it's not being called** - evidence: no activity logs.

### 2. Vercel Deployment Issue
- Commits are pushed to GitHub
- But Vercel may not have rebuilt with latest code
- Or deployment is in "Building" state, not "Ready"

### 3. Different Approval Method
User might be:
- Using a different button/action that bypasses the mutation
- Manually updating database via admin panel
- Using an old cached deployment URL

---

## Required Next Steps (User Actions)

### 1. Verify Vercel Deployment
- Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí CompPortal project ‚Üí Deployments
- Check if commit `eebda43` shows status "Ready"
- If "Building", wait for completion
- If failed, check build logs

### 2. Check Network Tab
While on `/dashboard/reservation-pipeline`:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click "Approve" button
4. Look for API call - should see `/api/trpc/reservation.approve`
5. **What do you actually see called?**

### 3. Check Vercel Function Logs
After approving a reservation:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Functions
2. Find the tRPC function
3. Look for `[EMAIL DEBUG]` console.log messages
4. **What logs appear (if any)?**

---

## If Mutation IS Being Called (Debug Logs Will Show)

The debug logs will reveal the exact failure point:
- `[EMAIL DEBUG] Starting email flow` ‚Üí Mutation reached email code
- `[EMAIL DEBUG] Studio owner check` ‚Üí Found/didn't find owner_id
- `[EMAIL DEBUG] Email preference check` ‚Üí User allowed/blocked emails
- `[EMAIL DEBUG] About to send email` ‚Üí Calling Resend API
- `[EMAIL DEBUG] Email send result` ‚Üí Success or error from Resend

## Summary for Next Session

**Problem:** Email notifications not working
**Root Cause:** `trpc.reservation.approve` mutation not executing
**Evidence:** Empty `activity_logs` and `email_logs` tables
**User Confirming:** Using correct page in incognito mode
**Hypothesis:** Either deployment hasn't completed OR frontend has a bug preventing mutation call

**Immediate Action Needed:**
User must check Vercel deployment status and browser network tab to confirm what's actually being called when they click "Approve".

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24 2:10pm EST (Session ending - auto-compact)
**Resume Point:** Wait for user to provide network tab + deployment status info
