# Post-DevTeam Session Issues

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Session:** DevTeam Protocol (16 fixes)
**Build:** 7f52cbf

---

## üö® P0 - CRITICAL (Blockers)

**Status:** ‚úÖ NO P0 BLOCKERS - Safe to launch!

**Issue #1 (Originally P0):** Downgraded to P2 after investigation revealed it's not a race condition. See below.

---

## P1 - HIGH (Pre-Launch)

### 2. Email Design: ReservationApproved Broken

**Issue:** Purple "Confirmed Spaces" bubble element renders outside grey container box

**Comparison:** SignupConfirmation email has correct design

**Location:** `src/emails/ReservationApproved.tsx`

**Fix Required:**
- Review container/box styling
- Match SignupConfirmation layout
- Test email rendering in multiple clients

### 3. Email Design: PaymentConfirmed Broken

**Issue:** Same bubble element issue as ReservationApproved

**Location:** `src/emails/PaymentConfirmed.tsx` (if exists)

**Fix Required:**
- Same fix as ReservationApproved

### 4. Counter Auto-Update Still Slow

**Issue:** After approval, counter doesn't update immediately - requires page refresh

**Note:** Agent 3 added `invalidate()` but it's not working as expected

**Location:** `src/components/ReservationPipeline.tsx` line 59

**Investigation:**
- Check if `invalidate()` is being called
- Check if query is actually refetching
- May need `refetch()` in addition to `invalidate()`
- May be related to race condition issue

---

## P2 - MEDIUM (Polish)

### 5. Remove REBUILD Badge from Studio Pipeline

**Issue:** Studio Pipeline button shows "üî® REBUILD" badge

**Location:** Likely in `src/components/CompetitionDirectorDashboard.tsx` or pipeline header

**Fix Required:**
- Remove REBUILD badge from button/header
- This is production-ready, no longer a rebuild

### 6. Double Toast on Routine Creation

**Issue:** Creating a routine shows TWO toasts:
1. "Routine Created Successfully"
2. "Entry created successfully"

**Location:** `src/components/rebuild/entries/EntryCreateFormV2.tsx` or router

**Fix Required:**
- Check if mutation triggers two success callbacks
- Check if component and router both show toasts
- Remove duplicate toast notification

### 7. Add "Title Status" Column to Entries Table

**Issue:** SD entries table at `/dashboard/entries` should show title upgrade status

**Requirement:** Display "$30 upgrade" marker for entries with title upgrades

**Location:** `src/app/dashboard/entries/page.tsx` or entries table component

**Fix Required:**
- Add column header "Title Status"
- Show "$30" or "Upgrade" badge when `title_upgrade = true`
- Add to both list and card views

### 1. Reservation Input Validation (Downgraded from P0)

**Issue:** No frontend validation prevents users from typing unreasonable numbers (e.g., 500 instead of 5)

**Example:** Studio typed "500" when they meant "5", system accepted with no warning

**Investigation:** Session 23 (45 min) - Confirmed NOT a race condition. Studio created reservation with 500 spaces, CD approved exactly what was requested. See `INVESTIGATION_REPORT_500_ROUTINES.md`.

**Location:** `src/components/ReservationForm.tsx` (line 217, 228)

**Fix Required:**
- Add `max="200"` to number input
- Add warning message for values >100
- Add confirmation dialog before submitting large requests
- Lower backend max from 1000 to 300

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
