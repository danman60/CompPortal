## Test Environment Analysis

### Database State (via SQL queries)

**EMPWR Dance - London Event:**
- Total capacity: 583 tokens (inconsistent with UI showing 600)
- Reserved: 101 tokens
- Available: 482 tokens

**Reservations Found:** 7 total across all events
```
1. Cassiah's Dance Company - EMPWR London - 15 spaces PENDING (not approved)
2. HECR - EMPWR London - 1 approved, 0 routines created
3. Ryan'sTipsyTippyToes - EMPWR London - 100 approved, 1 routine (NOT confirmed)
4-7. [Other events with minimal data]
```

**Invoices Found:** 3 total
- All marked as "PAID" status
- **CRITICAL:** All have `is_locked = false` (should be true when paid/sent)

**Competition Entries (Routines):**
- Total: 7 routines across all events
- **Confirmed routines: 0** (all are draft/registered)
- This blocks testing of "confirmed routines only" invoice feature

### Test Account Status
- **Competition Director:** 1-click auth working
- **Studio Director demo:** Invalid credentials (demo.studio@gmail.com)
- **Studio Director real:** danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com works, but NEW account (no test data)

---

## Test Suite Results

### ✅ Test Suite 4: Forgot Password Feature
**Status:** PASSED (3/3 tests)
**Priority:** MEDIUM

#### Test 4.1: Forgot Password Link Visible ✅
- **Result:** PASS
- **Evidence:** `06_login_page_forgot_password_visible.png`
- **Verification:** Link visible next to password field, correct styling

#### Test 4.2: Forgot Password Flow ✅
- **Result:** PASS
- **Evidence:** `07_reset_password_page.png`, `08_reset_password_success.png`
- **Steps Executed:**
  1. Clicked "Forgot password?" link → Navigated to `/reset-password`
  2. Entered email: danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com
  3. Clicked "Send Reset Link"
  4. Success message displayed: "Password reset email sent. Check your inbox."
- **Verification:** Form cleared, no errors, appropriate message shown

#### Test 4.3: Invalid Email Handling ✅
- **Result:** PASS (inferred)
- **Note:** Supabase doesn't reveal if email exists (security best practice)
- **Behavior:** Same success message for valid/invalid emails

**Conclusion:** Forgot password feature working as designed. Email delivery not tested (requires SMTP configuration verification).

### ❌ Test Suite 1: Auto-Close Reservations with Token Refund
**Status:** BLOCKED - No suitable test data
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Blocker:** No reservations exist where:
- `spaces_confirmed > 0` AND
- Routine count < `spaces_confirmed` AND
- Routines have status = 'confirmed'

**Current Data State:**
```sql
-- Ryan'sTipsyTippyToes: 100 approved, 1 routine created
-- But routine status is NOT 'confirmed'
SELECT status FROM competition_entries
WHERE reservation_id = '6a02ec3b-9e4e-4819-8581-1df7d2c6351f';
-- Result: 'registered' or 'draft' (not 'confirmed')
```

**Tests Unable to Execute:**
- ❌ Test 1.1: Normal Flow (Full Utilization)
- ❌ Test 1.2: Underutilization Flow (Partial Usage)
- ❌ Test 1.3: Token Refund Visible to CD
- ❌ Test 1.4: Studio Cannot Reuse Closed Reservation

**Code Verification (from commit 48edcf7):**
```typescript
// entry.ts:179-209 - Auto-close logic exists
if (confirmedCount < reservation.spaces_confirmed) {
  const unusedSpaces = reservation.spaces_confirmed - confirmedCount;
  await ctx.prisma.reservations.update({
    where: { id: input.reservationId },
    data: {
      is_closed: true,
      spaces_confirmed: confirmedCount
    }
  });
  // Refund tokens...
}
```

**Recommendation:** Requires manual test data creation or waiting for real studio to submit summary.

---

### ❌ Test Suite 2: Invoice Lock After Send
**Status:** BLOCKED - Invoice system errors
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Critical Bug #1: Invoice Pages Return 400/404 Errors**

**Evidence:**
- `04_invoices_list_all_paid.png` - List page loads successfully
- `05_invoice_400_error.png` - Detail page shows "Invoice Not Found"

**Error Details:**
```
URL Attempted: /dashboard/invoices/a00671f4-d645-4f34-8ebb-df8130baa802/79cef00c-e163-449c-9f3c-d021fbb4d672
HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request
UI Message: "❌ Invoice Not Found - Unable to generate invoice for this studio and competition."
```

**Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT id, status, is_locked FROM invoices
WHERE id = 'eb2a056c-f627-4e00-9dfb-2e10acbb8d78';

Result:
- id: eb2a056c-f627-4e00-9dfb-2e10acbb8d78
- status: 'PAID'
- is_locked: false  <-- CRITICAL BUG #2
```

**Critical Bug #2: Invoices Not Locking When Sent/Paid**

All 3 production invoices have:
- `status = 'PAID'`
- `is_locked = false` (WRONG - should be true)

**Expected Behavior (from code commit 15a2527):**
```typescript
// invoice.ts:661, 881-883
if (data.status === 'SENT') {
  updateData.is_locked = true;
}
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Invoices may have been marked PAID manually (bypassing lock trigger)
2. Lock logic only triggers on status = 'SENT', not 'PAID'
3. Historical data migrated without lock field set

**Tests Unable to Execute:**
- ❌ Test 2.1: Invoice Lock on Send
- ❌ Test 2.2: Prevent Editing Locked Invoice (CD)
- ❌ Test 2.3: Prevent Editing Locked Invoice (SD)
- ❌ Test 2.4: Draft Invoice Still Editable

**Immediate Impact:** Competition Directors could accidentally edit sent invoices, causing discrepancies.

---

### ❌ Test Suite 3: Invoice Confirmed Routines Only
**Status:** BLOCKED - No confirmed routines in database
**Priority:** HIGH

**Blocker:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries WHERE status = 'confirmed';
-- Result: 0
```

**Current Routine Statuses:**
- `registered`: 7 routines
- `confirmed`: 0 routines
- `draft`: Unknown count

**Code Verification (from commit 15a2527):**
Invoice generation correctly filters:
```typescript
// invoice.ts:140, 256, 509, 564
status: 'confirmed'  // Only includes confirmed routines
```

**Tests Unable to Execute:**
- ❌ Test 3.1: Invoice Excludes Draft Routines
- ❌ Test 3.2: Invoice Excludes Registered (Non-Confirmed)
- ❌ Test 3.3: Invoice Total Calculation Correct
- ❌ Test 3.4: Previously Cancelled Routines Excluded

**Note:** Feature likely working correctly based on code review, but cannot verify in production without test data.

---

### ⏭️ Test Suite 6: Regression Tests
**Status:** SKIPPED - New Studio Director account has no data
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Regression Tests Planned:**
1. ⏭️ CSV Import Still Works
2. ⏭️ Event Capacity Card Accuracy
3. ⏭️ Deny Reservation Button Works
4. ⏭️ Manual Payment Banner Visible

**Blocker:**
- Studio Director account `danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com` is brand new
- Account created during this test session (onboarding completed)
- Zero dancers, zero reservations, zero routines
- Cannot test features requiring existing data

**Evidence:** `09_sd_dashboard_new_account.png` shows:
```
My Dancers: 0
My Reservations: 0
My Routines: 0
```

## Critical Findings Summary

### 🔴 CRITICAL BUGS FOUND

#### Bug #1: Invoice Detail Pages Return 400 Error
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Competition Directors cannot view invoice details
- **Affected Users:** All roles trying to view invoices
- **Reproduction:** Click any invoice "View" button from `/dashboard/invoices/all`
- **URL Pattern:** `/dashboard/invoices/{invoice_id}/{competition_id}`
- **Error:** 400 Bad Request → "Invoice Not Found"
- **Evidence:** Screenshots 04, 05

**Possible Causes:**
1. Route parameter mismatch (expects different URL structure)
2. Invoice generation query failing silently
3. RLS (Row Level Security) blocking access
4. Missing JOIN or data corruption

**Recommended Fix Priority:** IMMEDIATE - Blocks all invoice operations

---

#### Bug #2: Invoices Not Locking When Sent/Paid
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Sent/paid invoices can be edited, causing financial discrepancies
- **Affected Data:** All 3 production invoices
- **Evidence:** Database query shows `is_locked = false` for PAID invoices
- **Expected:** `is_locked = true` when status changes to SENT

**Root Cause:**
Lock trigger only fires on status = 'SENT', but invoices are status = 'PAID':
```typescript
// Current code (invoice.ts:881-883)
if (data.status === 'SENT') {
  updateData.is_locked = true;
}
```

**Missing:** Lock trigger for 'PAID' status transitions

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
if (data.status === 'SENT' || data.status === 'PAID') {
  updateData.is_locked = true;
}
```

**Data Migration Needed:**
```sql
UPDATE invoices
SET is_locked = true
WHERE status IN ('SENT', 'PAID');
```

---

### ⚠️ DATA INCONSISTENCIES

#### Inconsistency #1: Event Capacity Mismatch
- **UI Display:** "Total: 600 spaces"
- **Database:** `total_reservation_tokens = 583`
- **Location:** Event capacity cards on director panel
- **Impact:** Confusion about actual available tokens

#### Inconsistency #2: Invoice Route Structure
- **List View URL:** `/dashboard/invoices/all`
- **Detail View URL (expected):** `/dashboard/invoices/{invoice_id}`
- **Detail View URL (actual):** `/dashboard/invoices/{invoice_id}/{competition_id}`
- **Result:** 404 errors when using single-param URL

## Database Queries Executed

### Query 1: Reservation State Analysis
```sql
SELECT
  r.id as reservation_id,
  s.name as studio_name,
  c.name as competition_name,
  r.spaces_requested,
  r.spaces_confirmed,
  r.is_closed,
  r.status as reservation_status,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries e
   WHERE e.reservation_id = r.id AND e.status = 'confirmed') as confirmed_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries e
   WHERE e.reservation_id = r.id) as total_entries
FROM reservations r
JOIN studios s ON r.studio_id = s.id
JOIN competitions c ON r.competition_id = c.id
WHERE c.name = 'EMPWR Dance - London'
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC;
```

**Result:** 3 reservations, 0 confirmed routines

### Query 2: Invoice Lock Status
```sql
SELECT
  i.id,
  s.name as studio_name,
  c.name as competition_name,
  i.status,
  i.is_locked,
  i.subtotal,
  i.total,
  i.created_at
FROM invoices i
JOIN studios s ON i.studio_id = s.id
JOIN competitions c ON i.competition_id = c.id
ORDER BY i.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result:** 3 invoices, all PAID, **none locked**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Next Test Session)

1. **Fix Invoice Detail Pages (CRITICAL)**
   - Investigate route handler for `/dashboard/invoices/[invoiceId]/[competitionId]`
   - Check tRPC router `invoice.getOne` query
   - Verify RLS policies on invoices table
   - Test with existing invoice IDs

2. **Implement Invoice Lock for PAID Status (CRITICAL)**
   - Update lock trigger to include PAID status
   - Run migration to lock existing PAID invoices
   - Add UI indicator showing lock status

3. **Create Test Data for Auto-Close Feature (HIGH)**
   - Option A: Manual workflow (SD creates routines → submits summary)
   - Option B: Seed script with realistic test data
   - Required: Reservation with 10+ confirmed routines where confirmed < approved

4. **Verify Demo Credentials (MEDIUM)**
   - Update demo.studio@gmail.com password OR
   - Document that danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com is the SD test account

### Testing Environment Improvements

1. **Automated Seeding Script**
   ```bash
   npm run seed:test-data
   ```
   Should create:
   - 2 studios with realistic data
   - 10 dancers per studio
   - 3 reservations (pending, approved, submitted)
   - 15 routines (draft, registered, confirmed)
   - 2 invoices (draft, sent, paid)

2. **Test Data Reset Command**
   ```bash
   npm run reset:test-env
   ```
   Clears test data, preserves demo accounts

3. **Database Snapshots**
   - Save "golden state" after each major feature
   - Restore for regression testing

**Database Snapshot Time:** 2025-10-24 ~18:00 UTC
**Code Version:** Commit 48edcf7 (Session 3 - Auto-close complete)

---

## Conclusion

Production testing session **did not achieve primary objectives** due to:
1. Critical invoice system bugs blocking all invoice tests
2. Insufficient test data blocking auto-close and confirmed routine tests
3. New Studio Director account lacking historical data for regression tests

**However, the session was valuable** because it:
- ✅ Identified 2 critical bugs requiring immediate fixes
- ✅ Validated forgot password feature works correctly
- ✅ Documented exact production data state
- ✅ Provided actionable recommendations with evidence

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT MARK FEATURES AS PRODUCTION-READY** until:
1. Invoice bugs are fixed and re-tested
2. Auto-close feature is validated with real workflow
3. Confirmed routine filtering is verified with actual summaries

**Estimated Re-Test Time:** 2-3 hours after bugs fixed and test data created.
