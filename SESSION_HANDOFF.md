## 🚀 Next Session Priorities

### High Priority (Before Launch)
1. **📹 Demo Video**
   - 5-10 minute walkthrough
   - Show all core workflows:
     - Studio Director: Create reservation → Routine creation
     - Competition Director: Approve reservation
     - Judge: Score routines
   - Highlight space limit enforcement

2. **📊 Stakeholder Presentation**
   - MVP feature summary
   - Security hardening results
   - Production readiness assessment
   - Launch timeline

3. **🧪 Final Smoke Test**
   - Run through complete user journey
   - Verify all workflows still functional
   - Check production deployment one more time

### Medium Priority (Post-Launch)
4. **📧 Email Notifications** - Currently manual
5. **📊 Monitoring Setup** - Add Sentry, Vercel Analytics
6. **🧪 Automated Tests** - Expand from 40% to 70%

### Low Priority (Technical Debt)
7. **Type Safety** - Fix remaining `any` types
8. **Error Logging** - Upgrade from console to structured logging
9. **Performance Monitoring** - Add APM

## 📝 Session Notes

### What Went Well
- Discovered and fixed 2 critical production bugs before launch
- Comprehensive testing prevented major issues
- Security audit found no additional vulnerabilities
