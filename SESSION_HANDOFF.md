## Session Summary

**Duration**: Full context session
**Focus**: QA Bug Fixes + Testing Protocol Creation
**Status**: ✅ All bugs fixed, comprehensive testing protocol ready

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Competition Director Dashboard Fixes (4 commits)
- **ca30582**: Dashboard reordering (Events → Invoices → Studios first)
- **3672393**: Dancers card hidden for CDs, drag-drop navigation improved
- **416c087**: Enhanced drag-drop with pointer-events-none + 10px activation
- **5f0d6ac**: Studios card clickable, "Routines" renamed, animated gradient added

**Fixed Issues**:
- ✅ Dancers card now hidden for Competition Directors (visible only for Studio Directors)
- ✅ Dashboard card order corrected (Events, Invoices, Studios prioritized)
- ✅ Studios card now clickable/navigable
- ✅ Drag-drop cards no longer navigate on release (400ms cooldown, pointer-events-none)
- ✅ Grid snapping fixed (verticalListSortingStrategy → rectSortingStrategy)
- ✅ "All Routines" simplified to "Routines"
- ✅ Subtle animated pink/purple gradient background (15% opacity)

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Protocol (3 commits)

- **330a208**: Added complete MVP workflow + role switching tests (529 lines)
- **2ace369**: TESTING_PREREQUISITES.md (585 lines) - prerequisite checklist

**Testing Coverage**:
- 25 individual tests (13 Studio Director, 12 Competition Director)
- Complete workflow: Reservation → Approval → Routines → Invoices → Payment (8 phases)
- Dancer assignment workflow with cross-role verification (5 steps)
- Real database mutation verification with persistence checks

### 3. Documentation Updates (2 commits)
- **174ff81**: PROJECT_STATUS.md updated with testing protocol
- **27c0669**: Next session plan added (MCP database preparation tasks)

---

## Current State

### Production Deployment
- **URL**: https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/
- **Latest Commit**: 27c0669
- **Build Status**: ✅ All 40 routes compile
- **Deployment**: ✅ Auto-deployed via Vercel

### Code Quality
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All routes functional
- ✅ Recent UX improvements deployed
- ✅ Drag-drop issues resolved

### Testing Readiness
- ✅ Test protocol created (CHATGPT_TEST_AGENT_PROMPT.md)
- ⚠️ Prerequisites documented but NOT verified (TESTING_PREREQUISITES.md)
- ❓ Demo accounts may not exist
- ❓ Database may not have correct data states (pending reservations, unpaid invoices)

---

## Next Session: Database Preparation with MCP

**Objective**: Verify and prepare production database for testing using Supabase MCP tools

### Step-by-Step Plan

**1. Check Demo Accounts (Supabase MCP)**
```typescript
// Query auth.users table
supabase:execute_sql("SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email IN ('demo.studio@gmail.com', 'demo.director@gmail.com')")

// Query user_profiles table
supabase:execute_sql("SELECT id, email, role FROM user_profiles WHERE email IN ('demo.studio@gmail.com', 'demo.director@gmail.com')")

// Expected: 2 users with correct roles
// If missing: Document manual creation steps (MCP can't create Supabase Auth users)
```

**2. Check Data States (Supabase MCP)**
```typescript
// Check pending reservations
supabase:execute_sql(`
  SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_count
  FROM reservations
  WHERE status = 'pending'
`)

// Check approved reservations with space
supabase:execute_sql(`
  SELECT
    r.id,
    s.name as studio,
    r.spaces_confirmed,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries WHERE reservation_id = r.id) as used
  FROM reservations r
  JOIN studios s ON r.studio_id = s.id
  WHERE r.status = 'approved'
    AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries WHERE reservation_id = r.id) < r.spaces_confirmed
`)

// Check unpaid invoices
supabase:execute_sql(`
  SELECT COUNT(*) as unpaid_count
  FROM reservations
  WHERE "paymentStatus" IN ('pending', 'sent')
`)

// Expected: At least 1 of each for testing workflows
```

**3. Reset Data if Needed (Choose One)**

**Option A: Full Reset (Clean Slate)**
```bash
# Run seed script
Bash("cd /d/ClaudeCode/CompPortal && npm run seed")
```

**Option B: Partial Reset (SQL)**
```typescript
// Reset 2 reservations to pending
supabase:execute_sql(`
  UPDATE reservations
  SET status = 'pending'
  WHERE status = 'approved'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 2
`)

// Reset 2 invoices to unpaid
supabase:execute_sql(`
  UPDATE reservations
  SET "paymentStatus" = 'pending'
  WHERE "paymentStatus" = 'paid'
  ORDER BY updated_at DESC
  LIMIT 2
`)

// Free up space (delete 3 routines from an approved reservation)
supabase:execute_sql(`
  DELETE FROM competition_entries
  WHERE reservation_id = '<reservation_id>'
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 3
`)
```

**4. Verify Production Deployment (Vercel MCP)**
```typescript
// Check latest deployment
vercel:get_deployments({ limit: 1 })

// If errors, get build logs
vercel:get_build_logs({ deploymentId: '<deployment_id>' })
```

**5. Quick Smoke Test (Playwright MCP - Optional)**
```typescript
// Test authentication
playwright:browser_navigate({ url: 'https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/login' })
playwright:browser_take_screenshot({ filename: 'login-page.png' })

// Try logging in (if credentials work)
playwright:browser_type({
  element: 'email input',
  ref: 'input[type="email"]',
  text: 'demo.studio@gmail.com'
})
// etc.
```

## Key Files for Next Session

**Must Read**:
1. `TESTING_PREREQUISITES.md` - Complete checklist with all SQL queries
2. `CHATGPT_TEST_AGENT_PROMPT.md` - Testing protocol to execute after prep
3. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Latest status and next session plan

**Reference if Needed**:
4. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
5. `COMPPORTAL.txt` - Project credentials and quick reference

---

## Success Criteria for Next Session

After MCP preparation, the database should have:
- ✅ Demo accounts exist and authenticate
- ✅ At least 1 PENDING reservation
- ✅ At least 1 APPROVED reservation with 3+ available spaces
- ✅ At least 1 UNPAID invoice
- ✅ At least 5 unassigned dancers
- ✅ Demo Dance Studio owned by demo.studio@gmail.com
- ✅ Latest deployment is successful (no errors)

**Then**: Ready to execute CHATGPT_TEST_AGENT_PROMPT.md for comprehensive testing.

---

## Context Status

**Current Usage**: ~132k / 200k tokens (66%)
**Recommendation**: Next session can continue with full context or start fresh
**State**: All work committed and pushed to GitHub (27c0669)

---

## Quick Start for Next Session

**Command to resume**:
```
Continue from SESSION_HANDOFF.md - Use Supabase MCP to prepare database for testing.
Read TESTING_PREREQUISITES.md for SQL queries. Goal: Verify demo accounts exist
and reset data to testable states (pending reservations, unpaid invoices, available spaces).
```

**Session End**: Ready for auto-compact and next session handoff ✅
