# Autonomous Agent Instructions for CompPortal Development

## Purpose
This document instructs an autonomous agent on how to prompt Claude Code to continue building the CompPortal project autonomously, following established patterns and priorities.

---

## Critical Context to Include in Every Prompt

### 1. Project Identity & Location
```
Project: GlowDance Competition Portal (CompPortal)
Location: D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal
Tracker: D:\ClaudeCode\COMPPORTAL.txt
Status Doc: D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal\PROJECT_STATUS.md
Current Phase: Backend Feature Development - 70% Complete
```

### 2. Current Architecture & Tech Stack
```
Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)
Language: TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
ORM: Prisma
API: tRPC
Auth: Supabase Auth
Storage: Supabase Storage
Email: Resend + React Email
Styling: Tailwind CSS with glassmorphic design
```

### 3. Established Design Patterns

**UI/UX Standards**:
- Glassmorphic design: `bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-md rounded-xl border border-white/20`
- Gradient backgrounds: `bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-900 via-indigo-900 to-blue-900`
- Color scheme: Purple/pink/blue gradients with white text
- Icons: Emoji-based (üé≠, üìÖ, üè¢, etc.)
- No external icon libraries
- Responsive: Mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints

**Code Organization**:
- tRPC routers in `src/server/routers/`
- All routers must be added to `src/server/routers/_app.ts`
- React components in `src/components/`
- Utility libraries in `src/lib/`
- Page routes in `src/app/dashboard/[feature]/page.tsx`
- Server components for auth-protected pages
- Client components (`'use client'`) for interactive UI

**Naming Conventions**:
- Prisma relations: Use exact schema names (e.g., `dance_categories`, `entry_participants`, `competition_entries`)
- Field names: Use snake_case for database fields, match Prisma schema exactly
- Functions: camelCase
- Components: PascalCase
- Files: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for components

**Critical Prisma Schema Notes**:
- `competition_start_date` NOT `start_date`
- `dance_categories` NOT `categories`
- `entry_participants` NOT `competition_entry_participants`
- `competitions` is the relation name, not `competition`

5. Update _app.ts to include any new routers
6. Build completes without errors
7. Update COMPPORTAL.txt with session details
8. Commit with detailed message following established format
9. Push to GitHub

**Expected Deliverables**:

## Critical Rules for Autonomous Development

### DO ‚úÖ
1. **Always read COMPPORTAL.txt first** to understand current status
2. **Check latest commit** to know what was last completed
3. **Follow established patterns** for UI, code structure, naming
4. **Build and verify** before committing (run `npm run build`)
5. **Use TodoWrite tool** to track multi-step work
6. **Update tracker files** (COMPPORTAL.txt, PROJECT_STATUS.md)
7. **Write detailed commit messages** with feature descriptions
8. **Test that all 17+ routes compile** successfully
9. **Push to GitHub** after successful commit
10. **Use exact Prisma field names** from schema (read it if unsure)

### DON'T ‚ùå
1. **Don't create placeholder/dummy data** in production code
2. **Don't use external icon libraries** (use emojis instead)
3. **Don't skip build verification** before committing
4. **Don't assume field names** (competition_start_date not start_date)
5. **Don't forget to add routers** to _app.ts
6. **Don't create files without purpose** (only what's needed)
7. **Don't change established UI patterns** (keep glassmorphic style)
8. **Don't commit without updating tracker** files
9. **Don't skip git push** after successful commit
10. **Don't deviate from roadmap** priorities without reason

## Context Refresh Strategy

Since conversations can get summarized, include this context in every prompt:

### Essential Context Block
```markdown
**Critical Context**:
- Project: CompPortal at D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal
- Tech: Next.js 15, tRPC, Prisma, Supabase, TypeScript
- UI: Glassmorphic purple/pink gradients, emoji icons
- Current: Phase 2 MVP - 70% complete
- Next: [Specific feature from roadmap]
- Patterns: Follow existing code style in src/components/ and src/server/routers/
- Schema: Use exact Prisma field names (read prisma/schema.prisma if unsure)
```

---

## Quality Gates Before Commit

### Must Pass
1. ‚úÖ `npm run build` succeeds
2. ‚úÖ All routes compile (check build output)
3. ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
4. ‚úÖ All imports resolve
5. ‚úÖ tRPC router added to _app.ts (if new router)
6. ‚úÖ Prisma field names match schema
7. ‚úÖ UI follows glassmorphic pattern
8. ‚úÖ Components use 'use client' where needed
9. ‚úÖ Server components use await for Supabase

### Should Pass

## Recovery Instructions (If Build Fails)

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue**: Module not found '@/lib/[something]'
- **Fix**: Check file exists, check import path uses @ alias correctly

**Issue**: Type errors with Prisma relations
- **Fix**: Read `prisma/schema.prisma`, use exact relation names

**Issue**: "createServerClient is not exported"
- **Fix**: Use `createServerSupabaseClient` from '@/lib/supabase-server-client'

**Issue**: React Query deprecated warnings
- **Fix**: Use async/await pattern with refetch() instead of onSuccess callbacks

**Issue**: "can't read property of undefined"
- **Fix**: Add optional chaining `?.` and null checks

**Issue**: Build timeout
- **Fix**: Check for circular dependencies, simplify imports

### Debug Process
1. Read error message carefully
2. Check import paths
3. Verify Prisma field names
4. Check for typos in relation names
5. Read related existing code for patterns
6. Fix and rebuild
7. Don't commit until build succeeds

## Critical Files Reference

### Must Read Before Starting
- `D:\ClaudeCode\COMPPORTAL.txt` - Current status and history
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema (for exact field names)
- `src/server/routers/_app.ts` - Router registry (must update)

### Examples to Reference
- `src/components/SchedulingManager.tsx` - Complex UI pattern
- `src/server/routers/scheduling.ts` - Complex router pattern
- `src/lib/scheduling.ts` - Utility library pattern
- `src/app/dashboard/scheduling/page.tsx` - Protected page pattern

### Always Update
- `D:\ClaudeCode\COMPPORTAL.txt` - Detailed changelog
- `D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal\PROJECT_STATUS.md` - High-level status

---

## Final Agent Instructions

**Every prompt should**:
1. Include project context block
2. Specify exact next feature from roadmap
3. List expected deliverables
4. Remind about quality gates
5. Request build verification
6. Request tracker updates
7. Request git commit/push

**Every response should**:
1. Confirm understanding of task
2. Read COMPPORTAL.txt first
3. Implement feature completely
4. Run build to verify
5. Update tracker files
6. Commit with detailed message
7. Push to GitHub
8. Summarize what was accomplished

---

## Emergency Protocols

**If build fails repeatedly**:
- Read existing similar code
- Check Prisma schema field names
- Verify import paths
- Simplify implementation
- Ask for help with specific error

**If stuck on feature**:
- Break into smaller subtasks
- Implement minimal version first
- Reference similar existing features
- Use TodoWrite to track progress

**If context lost**:
- Read COMPPORTAL.txt completely
- Check latest git commits
- Review recent code changes
- Understand current phase

---

## Autonomous Development Loop

```
1. Agent sends prompt with context + next task
2. Claude reads COMPPORTAL.txt
3. Claude checks latest commit
4. Claude implements feature
5. Claude verifies build
6. Claude updates tracker
7. Claude commits + pushes
8. Claude reports completion
9. Agent sends next prompt (repeat)
```

This loop continues until roadmap complete or human intervention needed.

---

## Contact/Escalation

**When to pause autonomous development**:
- Build fails after 3 attempts
- Feature requires design decisions
- Unclear requirements
- Need external services setup
- Database migration needed
- Breaking changes required

**Report to human**:
- Current status
- Blockers encountered
- Decisions needed
- Recommended next steps
