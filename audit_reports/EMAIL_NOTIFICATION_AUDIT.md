# Email & Notification Audit

**Audit Date:** October 24, 2025
**Production Launch:** October 27, 2025 (3 days)
**Auditor:** Opus Pre-Production Audit

---

## Executive Summary

- **Implemented triggers:** Unknown (need code review)
- **Missing triggers:** Unknown (need to compare with spec)
- **Logging coverage:** 0% (NO email logs in database)
- **Error handling:** WEAK (based on previous session notes)

### Critical Findings
1. **NO EMAIL LOGS:** Database query returns zero email_logs records
2. **CAPACITY ERROR BLOCKING:** Session 8 notes indicate emails blocked by capacity errors
3. **NO ACTIVITY LOGS:** No evidence of activity logging
4. **MISSING RESEND INTEGRATION:** Previous issues with email delivery

---

## Missing Email Triggers

Based on RESEND_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md, these 9 triggers are required:

### Required Email Triggers (Phase 1 spec)
1. **reservation.approve** â†’ email to SD
   - Status: Implemented but was blocked by capacity errors (fixed in commit 86f21a4)

2. **reservation.reject** â†’ email to SD
   - Status: Unknown - need to verify implementation

3. **invoice.send** â†’ email to SD
   - Status: Unknown - need to verify implementation

4. **entry.summary_submit** â†’ email to CD
   - Status: Unknown - need to verify implementation

5. **payment.received** â†’ email to SD
   - Status: Unknown - need to verify implementation

6. **reminder.deadline** â†’ email to SD
   - Status: Not implemented (no cron/scheduler found)

7. **studio.approved** â†’ email to SD
   - Status: Unknown - need to verify implementation

8. **competition.created** â†’ email to CDs
   - Status: Unknown - need to verify implementation

9. **user.welcome** â†’ email to new user
   - Status: Unknown - need to verify implementation

## Logging Audit

### Email Logs
**Status:** NOT WORKING
**Evidence:** Query returns 0 records
**Missing Fields:** All logging is missing
**Risk:** Cannot debug email delivery issues in production

### Activity Logs
**Status:** NOT WORKING
**Evidence:** No activity_logs entries
**Risk:** No audit trail for critical operations

---

## Error Handling Audit

### Previous Issues (from SESSION 8)
**Problem:** Uncaught capacity error killed email sending
**Fix Applied:** Try/catch wrapper (commit 86f21a4)
**Current Status:** Unknown if fix is working

### Error Handling Pattern Issues
- Email errors can block mutations
- No retry logic
- No dead letter queue
- No monitoring/alerting

---

## Implementation Review

### Email Service Files
- `src/server/routers/email.ts` - Email router
- `src/server/routers/reservation.ts` - Should send approval/rejection emails
- `src/server/routers/invoice.ts` - Should send invoice emails
- `src/server/routers/entry.ts` - Should send summary emails
- `src/lib/services/emailService.ts` - Core email service

### Critical Gap
**NO EMAIL LOGS BEING WRITTEN**
Even if emails are being sent, there's no record of them.

---

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE (Before Production)
1. **VERIFY EMAIL DELIVERY** - Manually test each trigger
2. **ADD EMAIL LOGGING** - Every send attempt must log to email_logs
3. **ADD ACTIVITY LOGGING** - Every critical action must log to activity_logs
4. **TEST RESEND_API_KEY** - Confirm environment variable is set
5. **ADD ERROR ALERTS** - Email failures should alert admins

### Required Code Fix
```typescript
// In emailService.ts
async function sendEmail(template: string, to: string, data: any) {
  try {
    // Send email via Resend
    const result = await resend.emails.send({...});

    // ALWAYS log attempt
    await prisma.email_logs.create({
      data: {
        template_type: template,
        recipient_email: to,
        subject: data.subject,
        success: true,
        sent_at: new Date()
      }
    });

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    // Log failure
    await prisma.email_logs.create({
      data: {
        template_type: template,
        recipient_email: to,
        subject: data.subject,
        success: false,
        error_message: error.message,
        sent_at: new Date()
      }
    });

    // Don't throw - let operation continue
    console.error('Email failed but continuing:', error);
  }
}
```

## Risk Assessment

**Production Readiness: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL RISK**

With zero email logs and unknown delivery status, the system cannot go to production. Email notifications are critical for the reservation/invoice workflow.

**Minimum Required for Launch:**
1. Test all 9 email triggers manually
2. Verify email_logs table is being populated
3. Confirm RESEND_API_KEY is set in production
4. Add try/catch to all email sends
5. Test email delivery to real addresses

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for testing and fixes
