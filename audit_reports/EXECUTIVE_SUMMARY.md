# CompPortal Pre-Production Audit - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Audit Date:** October 24, 2025
**Production Launch:** October 27, 2025 (3 days)
**Auditor:** Opus Pre-Production Audit

---

## üî¥ OVERALL STATUS: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Critical Blockers:** 14
**High Priority Issues:** 18
**Medium Priority Issues:** 12
**Estimated Fix Time:** 25-35 hours (minimum)

---

## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. DATABASE SCHEMA (8 blockers)
- **MISSING TABLES:** `summaries`, `summary_entries` - breaks invoice flow
- **WRONG FIELD NAMES:** `spaces_requested` should be `entries_requested`
- **NO CAPACITY TRACKING:** Using tokens instead of remaining_capacity
- **MISSING INDEXES:** Performance will degrade immediately

### 2. SECURITY (3 blockers)
- **HARDCODED TENANT:** Middleware defaults to EMPWR tenant UUID
- **NO RLS ON AUDIT TABLE:** capacity_ledger exposed to all users
- **NO ROLE-BASED ROUTING:** Admin pages accessible to all users

### 3. BUSINESS LOGIC (3 blockers)
- **SUMMARY SUBMISSION BROKEN:** Can't complete reservation workflow
- **EMAIL LOGS MISSING:** Zero email tracking in production
- **AUTO-CLOSE NOT IMPLEMENTED:** Reservations never close

---

## ‚úÖ MINIMUM VIABLE LAUNCH REQUIREMENTS

### Non-Negotiable Fixes (14 items)
1. Create summaries & summary_entries tables
2. Fix reservation field names
3. Remove hardcoded tenant UUID
4. Enable RLS on capacity_ledger
5. Add role-based route protection
6. Implement summary submission flow
7. Add email logging
8. Test email delivery
9. Add critical database indexes
10. Remove EMPWR defaults file
11. Fix invoice generation flow
12. Add 'summarized' status
13. Validate reservation lifecycle
14. Test multi-tenant isolation

### Can Ship With Workarounds (8 items)

- No discount/credit mechanism
- No auto-close (manual process)
- Some type safety issues
- No sequential invoice numbers
- Missing some email triggers

- Limited reporting

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTION

### Option 1: DELAY LAUNCH (Recommended)
- **Delay:** 1 week
- **Use time to:** Fix all blockers properly
- **Result:** Stable, secure production system

### Option 2: EMERGENCY FIXES
- **Work:** 72 hours non-stop
- **Risk:** High chance of production issues
- **Result:** Barely functional, high-risk launch

### Option 3: PARTIAL LAUNCH
- **Launch:** Single tenant only (EMPWR)
- **Disable:** Multi-tenant features
- **Fix:** Over next 2 weeks
- **Result:** Limited but safer launch

## üìù DOCUMENTATION NEEDED

1. **Emergency Runbook** - How to handle production issues
2. **Email Trigger Map** - Which actions send which emails
3. **Capacity Management Guide** - How the token system works
4. **Multi-Tenant Setup** - How to onboard new tenants
5. **Invoice Flow Diagram** - Visual of reservation ‚Üí summary ‚Üí invoice

---

## üèÅ FINAL VERDICT

**RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT LAUNCH ON TUESDAY**

The system has fundamental architectural issues that will cause immediate production failures. The missing summaries table alone makes the invoice flow impossible. The hardcoded tenant ID will mix customer data. The lack of email logging makes debugging impossible.

**Minimum additional time needed:** 1 week with focused development

**Risk of launching as-is:** EXTREME

- Customer data corruption: HIGH
- Revenue loss: CERTAIN
- Security breach: PROBABLE
- Brand damage: SEVERE

---

## üìû ESCALATION CONTACTS

If launching anyway, ensure 24/7 coverage for:
1. Database administrator (summaries table creation)
2. Security expert (RLS and tenant isolation)
3. Backend developer (business logic fixes)
4. DevOps engineer (emergency deployments)
5. Customer support (handle complaints)
