# Next Session Priorities

## 1. Complete Dashboard Buttons for Emails (PRIORITY)

**Status:** 2/12 templates complete
**Remaining:** 10 templates need dashboard buttons

**See:** `EMAIL_DASHBOARD_BUTTONS_TODO.md` for complete checklist and pattern

**User requirement:** "all emails include a 1 click to get back into their dashboard for SD and CD"

Templates done:
- ✅ PaymentConfirmed.tsx
- ✅ InvoiceDelivery.tsx

Remaining (documented in TODO file):
- ReservationApproved, ReservationRejected, EntrySubmitted, MissingMusicReminder
- ReservationSubmitted, RoutineSummarySubmitted, StudioProfileSubmitted
- RegistrationConfirmation, StudioApproved, WelcomeEmail

## 2. Email Border Issues (COMPLETED ✅)

**Fixed this session:**
- PaymentConfirmed.tsx - Border spreading issue resolved
- EntrySubmitted.tsx - Border spreading issue resolved

**Issue:** Red circle in user's image showed sloppy border alignment. Root cause was spreading theme boxes (successBox, warningBox) that already had borderLeft defined, then overriding it. Fixed by using explicit style objects.

**Note:** Left red circle ("..." menu) was email client UI, not in template code.
