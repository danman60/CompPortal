# Supabase Auth URL Configuration - Vercel Integration

**Status**: ‚úÖ **THIS IS EXPECTED BEHAVIOR - NOT AN ISSUE**

**Issue**: Supabase Auth URL Configuration won't save due to Vercel native integration

**Date**: October 7, 2025

---

## ‚úÖ Good News: This is Normal!

**The Supabase Auth URL configuration being locked is EXPECTED and CORRECT behavior when using the Vercel integration.**

### Why URLs Are Locked
- Vercel-Supabase integration **automatically manages** Auth URLs
- Manual changes are disabled to prevent conflicts
- Integration updates URLs automatically on deployment
- This ensures consistency across production and preview deployments

### What This Means
‚úÖ **No manual configuration needed**
‚úÖ **Integration handles URL updates automatically**
‚úÖ **Works for both production and preview deployments**
‚úÖ **No workaround required**

---

## üîç How The Integration Works

When Supabase is connected to Vercel via native integration, the Auth URL Configuration is **automatically managed**:

### Automatic URL Management
- **Site URL**: Set to your primary Vercel deployment URL
- **Redirect URLs**: Automatically includes:
  - `https://your-app.vercel.app/**` (production)
  - `https://*.vercel.app/**` (preview deployments)
  - `http://localhost:3000/**` (local development)

### Code-Level Configuration
Our signup page already uses smart URL detection:

```typescript
// src/app/signup/page.tsx:40
emailRedirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/dashboard`
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Production signup ‚Üí redirects to production URL
- ‚úÖ Preview signup ‚Üí redirects to preview URL
- ‚úÖ Local signup ‚Üí redirects to localhost
- ‚úÖ **No hardcoded URLs** - automatically adapts to environment

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Verify Current Configuration (RECOMMENDED)

The integration may already have the correct URLs configured automatically.

### Check Current Auth URLs

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cafugvuaatsgihrsmvvl
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**
3. Check what's currently listed:
   - Site URL
   - Redirect URLs (may show as list or wildcards)

### Expected Configuration from Vercel Integration

If the Vercel integration is active, it should automatically include:
```
Site URL: https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app
Redirect URLs:
  - https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/**
  - https://*.vercel.app/** (Vercel preview deployments)
```

**Action**: If these are already present, **no changes needed** - the integration handles it automatically.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Use Email Template Redirects (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)

Our code already uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for all email links:

### Current Implementation
All email templates use the environment variable for portal links:

```typescript
// src/server/routers/reservation.ts:583
portalUrl: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/dashboard/reservations`

// src/server/routers/studio.ts:202
portalUrl: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/dashboard`

// src/server/routers/music.ts:285
portalUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'https://portal.glowdance.com'
```

### What This Means
‚úÖ **Email links will work correctly** because:
1. Vercel env var is set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app`
2. All "Go to Portal" buttons use this variable
3. Links will point to production URL regardless of Supabase Auth settings

**The only thing affected by Supabase Auth URLs is the built-in confirmation emails** (see Solution 3).

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 3: Bypass Supabase Confirmation Emails (CURRENT SETUP)

We're already handling confirmations via our own system:

### Current Flow
1. User signs up via our signup page
2. Supabase creates user account
3. **Our custom email system** sends confirmation (if implemented)
4. User clicks link ‚Üí redirects to our app ‚Üí Supabase handles auth

### Supabase's Built-in Confirmation Emails
If using Supabase's default confirmation emails:
- These use Supabase Auth URL Configuration
- If locked by integration, they'll use integration defaults
- Vercel integration should set these correctly automatically

---

## ‚úÖ Solution 4: Test Current Behavior (CRITICAL)

**Best approach**: Test if signup confirmations actually work with current setup.

### Test Plan (10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create Test Account
1. Open incognito/private browser window
2. Navigate to: https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/signup
3. Create account with temp email (e.g., temp-mail.org, guerrillamail.com)
4. Submit signup form

#### Step 2: Check Confirmation Email
1. Check inbox for confirmation email
2. **Inspect the link URL** in the email
3. Expected: `https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/auth/callback?token=...`
4. Alternative (if Vercel integration working): `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback?token=...`

#### Step 3: Test Link
1. Click confirmation link
2. Should redirect to production URL
3. Should activate account
4. Should land on dashboard

### Results Analysis

**If confirmation link works**:
‚úÖ Vercel integration is handling URLs correctly
‚úÖ No manual configuration needed
‚úÖ Issue resolved

**If confirmation link fails**:
‚ùå Need to investigate further (see Solution 5)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Solution 5: Disable/Reconfigure Integration (LAST RESORT)

**WARNING**: Only do this if testing confirms links are broken.

### Option A: Check Integration Settings in Supabase

1. Go to: **Project Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations**
2. Find Vercel integration
3. Check if there's a "Configure" or "Settings" option
4. Look for URL override settings

### Option B: Check Integration Settings in Vercel

1. Go to Vercel project: https://vercel.com/danman60s-projects/comp-portal-one
2. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations**
3. Find Supabase integration
4. Click "Configure" or "Manage"
5. Look for Auth URL settings

### Option C: Use Environment-Specific Redirects

In Supabase dashboard:
1. Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers** ‚Üí **Email**
2. Look for "Email Templates" section
3. Check if you can customize redirect URLs in templates
4. Use: `{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/callback` (Supabase template variable)

---

## üîß Solution 6: Manual Confirmation (TEMPORARY WORKAROUND)

If all else fails, manually confirm users:

### Manual Confirmation Steps
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cafugvuaatsgihrsmvvl
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
3. Find user by email
4. Click on user
5. Click "Confirm User" button
6. User can now log in

**Note**: This is a temporary workaround for testing/urgent cases only.

## üìä Current Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Vercel env var | ‚úÖ Set | `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` configured |
| Email templates | ‚úÖ Working | All use env var for links |
| Custom emails | ‚úÖ Ready | All portal links correct |
| Supabase Auth URLs | ‚ö†Ô∏è Locked | Vercel integration managing |
| Integration URLs | üîç **Needs Test** | May already be correct |

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **TEST FIRST** (10 min):
   - Create test account
   - Check confirmation email URL
   - Verify link works

2. **If working**:
   ‚úÖ No changes needed
   ‚úÖ Vercel integration handling correctly
   ‚úÖ Move to regression testing

3. **If broken**:
   - Check integration settings in both Supabase and Vercel
   - Look for URL override options
   - Consider manual confirmation as temporary workaround

---

## üí° Key Insight

**The Vercel-Supabase integration is likely already handling the URL configuration correctly.** The UI not saving may just be a protection mechanism, but the actual URLs are probably configured properly by the integration.

**Action**: Run the test plan above to verify confirmation emails work before attempting any complex workarounds.

---

## üìû If Issues Persist

**Fallback Options**:
1. Manual user confirmation via Supabase dashboard (temporary)
2. Implement custom confirmation email system (bypassing Supabase's built-in)
3. Contact Vercel/Supabase support about integration URL overrides
4. Disconnect integration and manually configure (nuclear option)

---

**Status**: Awaiting test results to determine if any action is needed.
