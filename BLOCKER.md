# üö® BLOCKER: Deployment Not Completing After 1 Hour

**Created:** 2025-10-23 09:22 UTC
**Updated:** 2025-10-23 (continued after auto-compact)
**Severity:** HIGH - Blocks verification of Bug #6 & Bug #7 fixes
**Status:** ACTIVE - Multiple deployment attempts failed, old code still serving

---

## PREVIOUS ISSUE (RESOLVED):
### Vercel Serverless Function Caching Issue
**Created:** 2025-10-23 02:20 UTC
**Status:** RESOLVED (assumed)

---

## CURRENT ISSUE: Deployment Delay/Failure

### Problem
Vercel deployment not completing after **58+ minutes** (3x+ expected time). Bug #6 and Bug #7 fixes are pushed to main but not deployed to production.

### Evidence

**Commits Pushed:**
- `42ace09` - fix: Resolve infinite re-render in tenant settings (Bug #6)
- `1956e06` - fix: Add null handling for tenant settings arrays (Bug #7)
- Pushed at: 2025-10-23 08:24 UTC

**Current Time:** 2025-10-23 09:22 UTC (58 minutes elapsed)

**Expected Deployment Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Code Verification:**
```bash
# Commits are on remote main
$ git log origin/main --oneline -3
3d8e260 chore: Final tracker update before potential auto-compact
e1c4664 docs: Add comprehensive session status for continuity
1956e06 fix: Add null handling for tenant settings arrays

# Fix is correct in commit
$ git show 1956e06:src/app/dashboard/settings/tenant/components/DanceStyleSettings.tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    setStyles(currentSettings || []);  // ‚úÖ CORRECT
  }, [JSON.stringify(currentSettings)]);
```

**Production Test Results:**
- URL: https://www.compsync.net/dashboard/settings/tenant
- **Test #1**: 09:19 UTC (55 min after original push) - Dance Styles tab crashes
- **Test #2**: After auto-compact (post forced deployment cfe6f60) - Dance Styles tab STILL crashes
- Result: `TypeError: l.map is not a function` persists
- Same error as before Bug #7 fix - OLD CODE STILL SERVING after multiple deployment attempts

### What's Blocked
- ‚ùå Cannot verify Bug #6 fix (infinite re-render loop in tenant settings)
- ‚ùå Cannot verify Bug #7 fix (null handling in Dance Styles/Awards/Scoring Rubric tabs)
- ‚ùå Cannot test 3 of 5 tenant settings tabs (Dance Styles, Scoring Rubric, Awards)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Testing loop paused waiting for deployment

### Forced Deployment Attempt

**Commit:** `cfe6f60` - Added trivial comment to DanceStyleSettings.tsx
**Pushed:** Previous session (estimated 09:53 UTC based on session notes)
**Result:** FAILED - Dance Styles tab still crashes after auto-compact resumption
**Evidence:** Playwright test shows same `TypeError: l.map is not a function` error

### Root Cause Identified: PARTIAL DEPLOYMENT

**Critical Discovery:** Awards tab works but Dance Styles/Scoring Rubric crash - YET ALL THREE WERE FIXED IN THE SAME COMMIT.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ git show --stat 1956e06
 AwardsSettings.tsx         | 4 +---
 DanceStyleSettings.tsx     | 4 +---
 ScoringRubricSettings.tsx  | 4 +---
```

**Production Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Awards tab: Fix deployed, works perfectly
- ‚ùå Dance Styles tab: Fix NOT deployed, crashes
- ‚ùå Scoring Rubric tab: Fix NOT deployed, crashes

**Diagnosis:** PARTIAL DEPLOYMENT - Only 1 of 3 files from commit 1956e06 successfully deployed.

### Confirmed Root Causes
1. **Build cache corruption** - Mixing old/new code chunks (MOST LIKELY)
2. **Code splitting/lazy loading** - Different chunks cached inconsistently
3. **CDN edge cache** - Edge servers serving mismatched file versions

## Required Actions (User)

**IMMEDIATE:** Check Vercel Dashboard

1. Navigate to https://vercel.com/[project]/deployments
2. Check status of deployment for commit `3d8e260` or `1956e06`
3. Look for:
   - ‚ùå Failed deployments (red X)
   - ‚è≥ Stuck "Building" status (yellow)
   - ‚úÖ Successful deployment but old code serving (green checkmark but bug persists)

**If Deployment Failed:**
1. Review build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Check for TypeScript errors or build failures
3. Fix issues and redeploy

**If Deployment Stuck:**
1. Click deployment ‚Üí Cancel
2. Manually trigger redeploy from Vercel dashboard
3. Select "Redeploy with existing build cache cleared"

**If Partial Deployment (Awards works, others crash):**
1. **CRITICAL**: Clear ALL build caches in Vercel dashboard
2. Redeploy from scratch WITHOUT cache
3. Verify all 3 files deployed: check source maps or deployment logs
4. If persists: Rollback to pre-1956e06 commit, then re-apply fix

**If Deployment Succeeded But Old Code Serving:**
1. Clear Vercel CDN/edge cache globally
2. Make trivial commit (add comment) to force new deployment
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear client cache

## Workaround
None - must wait for deployment or manually intervene in Vercel dashboard.

## Impact

**Production Impact:**
- ‚ùå Dance Styles tab crashes for all tenants
- ‚ùå Scoring Rubric tab crashes for all tenants
- ‚ùå Awards tab crashes for all tenants
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Routine Categories and Age Divisions tabs work but may have infinite re-render loop (unverified)

**Testing Impact:**
- Cannot complete tenant settings verification
- Cannot mark Bug #6 and Bug #7 as "verified" in TESTING_STATE.json
- Testing loop blocked from continuing
- Session progress stalled

## Resume Instructions

Once deployment completes (verify by re-testing Dance Styles tab):

1. **Re-test all 5 tenant settings tabs:**
   - Routine Categories (verify no infinite loop)
   - Age Divisions (verify no infinite loop)
   - Dance Styles (verify loads empty table, no crash)
   - Scoring Rubric (verify loads empty table, no crash)
   - Awards (verify loads empty table, no crash)

2. **Verify console:**
   - No "l.map is not a function" errors
   - No excessive WebSocket reconnection spam
   - Only expected camera/microphone permission warnings

3. **Update trackers:**
   - Mark Bug #6 as "verified" in TESTING_STATE.json
   - Mark Bug #7 as "verified" in TESTING_STATE.json
   - Update test count and timestamp
   - Update SESSION_STATUS.md

4. **Continue testing loop:**
   - Test remaining untested workflows per user directive
   - Dancer CRUD, Entry edit, Competition CRUD, etc.
