## Current State: ACTIVE TESTING - AWAITING DEPLOYMENT

### Session Progress

- **Build Status**: ✅ All passing

### Bugs Fixed This Session

#### Bug #6: Infinite Re-render Loop ✅ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: tRPC refetch creates new object references, triggering useEffect infinite loop
- **Solution**: JSON.stringify dependencies for value comparison
- **Files**: 6 components (all tenant settings tabs)
- **Commits**: 42ace09, 2417c5c
- **Status**: Code deployed, awaiting production verification

#### Bug #7: Null Handling in Array Components ✅ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: Production DB returns null, components expect arrays
- **Solution**: Always use fallback: `setState(value || [])`
- **Files**: DanceStyleSettings, AwardsSettings, ScoringRubricSettings
- **Commits**: 1956e06, 254539a
- **Status**: Code deployed, awaiting production verification

- **Observation**: Old code still serving (chunk hash: page-0bdce353d84aa7c4.js)
- **Expected**: Vercel deployment takes 5-15 minutes
- **Action**: Need to re-test after deployment completes

   - Entry edit workflow
   - Competition CRUD
   - Judge bulk operations
4. Update trackers with verification results
5. Document any new bugs found

### User Directive
"Continue testing loop until all workflows perfect; update trackers prior to auto compact"

### Notes
- All fixes are committed and pushed
- Build passes locally
- Production deployment in progress
- Session can continue after verification
- Trackers updated (TESTING_STATE.json current as of 08:32)

**Status**: Waiting for deployment verification, then continuing testing loop
