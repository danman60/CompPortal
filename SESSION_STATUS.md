### Bugs Fixed This Session

#### Bug #6: Infinite Re-render Loop ‚úÖ FIXED

- **Commits**: 42ace09, 2417c5c

### Next Actions (BLOCKED)

**IMMEDIATE - User Action Required:**
1. üö® Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status/errors
2. Manually redeploy or clear cache if needed (see BLOCKER.md)

**Once Deployment Completes:**
1. Re-test all 5 tenant settings tabs
2. Verify Bug #6 (infinite loop) and Bug #7 (null handling) fixes
3. Update TESTING_STATE.json with verification results
4. Continue testing untested workflows:
   - Dancer CRUD operations
   - Entry edit workflow
   - Competition CRUD
   - Judge bulk operations
5. Document any new bugs found

### User Directive
"Continue testing loop until all workflows perfect; update trackers prior to auto compact"

### Notes
- All fixes are committed and pushed
- Build passes locally (verified multiple times)
- Fix code verified correct in commits
- **BLOCKER**: Deployment not completing after 60+ minutes
- Requires user intervention in Vercel dashboard
- Testing loop cannot continue until deployment completes
- Trackers updated with blocker status

---

**Status**: üö® BLOCKED - Deployment issue, user action required
**Priority**: Resolve deployment blocker, then verify Bug #6 & #7 fixes
**Risk**: Medium - 3 tenant settings tabs broken in production (Dance Styles, Scoring Rubric, Awards)
