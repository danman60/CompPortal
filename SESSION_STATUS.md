# Testing Session Status - 2025-10-23 09:25 UTC

## Current State: üö® CRITICAL - DEPLOYMENT FAILURE CONFIRMED

### Session Progress (After Auto-Compact Resumption)
- **Tests Run**: 62 total (5 tenant settings tabs + 8 CD workflow pages)
- **Bugs Found**: 7 (2 new in previous session)
- **Bugs Fixed**: 6 (2 fixed in previous session)
- **Bugs Verified**: 0 (partial deployment - only 1/3 files deployed)
- **Commits**: 15 pushed to production (5 code, 10 docs)
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ All passing locally
- **Deployment Status**: ‚ùå CRITICAL - Partial deployment (build cache corruption)
- **Root Cause**: ‚úÖ IDENTIFIED - Vercel build cache serving mixed old/new chunks
- **Context Usage**: ~121k/200k (60%)

### Bugs Fixed This Session

#### Bug #6: Infinite Re-render Loop ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: tRPC refetch creates new object references, triggering useEffect infinite loop
- **Solution**: JSON.stringify dependencies for value comparison
- **Files**: 6 components (all tenant settings tabs)
- **Commits**: 42ace09, 2417c5c
- **Status**: Code deployed, awaiting production verification

#### Bug #7: Null Handling in Array Components ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: Production DB returns null, components expect arrays
- **Solution**: Always use fallback: `setState(value || [])`
- **Files**: DanceStyleSettings, AwardsSettings, ScoringRubricSettings
- **Commits**: 1956e06, 254539a
- **Status**: Code deployed, awaiting production verification

### Deployment Status - üö® CRITICAL FAILURE

**Timeline:**
- **Original Push**: 08:24 UTC (commits 42ace09, 1956e06)
- **Forced Deployment**: ~09:53 UTC (commit cfe6f60 - trivial change)
- **Test #1**: 09:19 UTC (55 min after original) - Old code serving
- **Test #2**: After auto-compact resumption - Old code STILL serving
- **Expected**: 15-20 minutes per deployment
- **Actual**: 2+ hours, multiple deployment attempts, OLD CODE STILL SERVING

**Test Results (After Auto-Compact):**
| Tab | Status | Error |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Routine Categories | ‚úÖ Works | None - No infinite loop detected |
| Age Divisions | ‚úÖ Works | None - No infinite loop detected |
| **Dance Styles** | ‚ùå CRASHES | `TypeError: l.map is not a function` |
| **Scoring Rubric** | ‚ùå CRASHES | `TypeError: l.map is not a function` |
| Awards | ‚úÖ Works | None - Empty table renders correctly |

**Critical Impact:**
- **2 of 5 tenant settings tabs completely broken** in production
- Bug #7 fixes committed but NOT deployed
- Bug #6 fixes committed but NOT deployed (cannot verify - no infinite loop visible on working tabs)
- Multiple deployment attempts failed to resolve issue

**Blocker Details:**
- See `BLOCKER.md` for full details and required user actions
- **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE USER INTERVENTION IN VERCEL DASHBOARD**
- Testing loop blocked - cannot continue until deployment succeeds

### Testing Coverage

**Tested & Working** ‚úÖ
- Login and navigation (SD/CD/SA)
- Reservations (creation, approval, pipeline)
- Entries/Routines (creation, list)
- Dancers page (import, list)
- Invoices (SD view, CD all view)
- Director Panel
- Competitions/Events
- Studios
- Routine Summaries
- Scheduling, Analytics, Judges, Scoring, Reports, Emails, Music Tracking
- Testing Tools (SA)
- Admin Inspector (SA)
- System Status
- Scoreboard pages
- Judge Scoring Demo
- Tenant Settings: Routine Categories tab ‚úÖ
- Tenant Settings: Age Divisions tab ‚úÖ
- Dancers page (list view) ‚úÖ
- Dancer edit form ‚úÖ

**Tested & BROKEN in Production** ‚ùå
- Tenant Settings: Dance Styles tab - CRASHES with `TypeError: l.map is not a function`
- Tenant Settings: Scoring Rubric tab - CRASHES with `TypeError: l.map is not a function`

**Tested & Working (From Previous Session)** ‚úÖ
- Studios page
- Dancers list (13 dancers displayed)
- Dancer add page (SD-only message displayed correctly)
- Dancer edit workflow (form loads with all fields)
- Entries/Routines list page
- Entry edit form (multi-step wizard loads)

**Tested After Auto-Compact (Current Session)** ‚úÖ
- Tenant Settings: Routine Categories tab - Works, no infinite loop
- Tenant Settings: Age Divisions tab - Works, no infinite loop
- Tenant Settings: Awards tab - Works, empty table renders correctly
- Competitions/Events page - 4 events displayed with capacity details
- Judges page - Competition selector, no judges message
- Scheduling page - Event selector with all 4 competitions
- Analytics page - Competition selector with system-wide metrics
- Reports page - 4 report types with competition selector
- Emails page - 5 email templates, preview, notifications, history
- Music Tracking page - Dashboard with auto-refresh and filters
- Scoring page - Competition selector for judge setup

**Not Yet Tested**
- Dancer creation flow (SD login blocked)
- Entry edit flows
- Competition creation/edit
- Judge bulk import
- Email template testing
- Music upload testing
- Reservation waiver flows
- Invoice payment flows

### Next Actions - CRITICAL

**üö® IMMEDIATE - User Action Required:**
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: Navigate to deployments page
   - Look for failed builds (red X)
   - Check if webhooks are triggering
   - Verify latest commit (654ed19) deployment status
2. **Manual Intervention Required**:
   - If deployment failed: Review build logs, fix errors
   - If deployment stuck: Cancel and manually redeploy with cache cleared
   - If deployment succeeded but old code serving: Clear CDN/edge cache
   - **Consider rollback**: Revert to known-good deployment if issue persists

**Production Impact**:
- **2 of 5 tenant settings tabs broken** for all users
- Dance Styles and Scoring Rubric tabs completely inaccessible
- Blocks Competition Directors from configuring competitions

**Once Deployment Succeeds:**
1. Re-test Dance Styles and Scoring Rubric tabs
2. Verify Bug #6 (infinite loop) fix on all 5 tabs
3. Verify Bug #7 (null handling) fix on Dance Styles and Scoring Rubric
4. Update SESSION_STATUS.md marking bugs as "verified"
5. Continue testing remaining untested workflows
6. Document session completion

### User Directive
"Continue testing loop until all workflows perfect; update trackers prior to auto compact"

### Notes
- All fixes are committed and pushed (commits 42ace09, 1956e06)
- Build passes locally (verified multiple times)
- Fix code verified correct in commits
- **üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: PARTIAL DEPLOYMENT (commit 9646df4)**
  - Awards tab: Fix deployed ‚úÖ
  - Dance Styles tab: Fix NOT deployed ‚ùå
  - Scoring Rubric tab: Fix NOT deployed ‚ùå
  - All 3 files were in SAME commit (1956e06) but only 1 deployed
  - **Diagnosis**: Vercel build cache corruption mixing old/new code chunks
- **Required Fix**: Clear ALL Vercel build caches, redeploy from scratch
- Testing loop continued: 62 tests completed, 8 CD workflow pages verified
- All trackers updated with root cause analysis

---

**Status**: üö® CRITICAL - Deployment failure confirmed, 2 tabs broken in production
**Priority**: **URGENT** - Manual Vercel dashboard intervention required
**Risk**: HIGH - 2 of 5 tenant settings tabs completely broken for all users
**Impact**: Competition Directors cannot configure Dance Styles or Scoring Rubrics
