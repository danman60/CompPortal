# Email Investigation Results

**Date**: October 7-8, 2025
**Issue**: Signup confirmation email not received

---

## üîç Key Findings

### Finding #1: No Recent Signup Detected
- ‚úÖ Checked auth.users table for last 5 minutes: **No new users**
- ‚úÖ Most recent user: `daniel@streamstage.live` (created hours ago)
- ‚ùì **Question**: What email address did you use for the test signup?

### Finding #2: Previous User Auto-Confirmed
The most recent user (`daniel@streamstage.live`) shows interesting behavior:

```
Created:    2025-10-08 03:03:54 UTC
Email Sent: 2025-10-08 03:03:54 UTC (confirmation_sent_at populated)
Confirmed:  2025-10-08 03:04:22 UTC (28 seconds later)
Status:     CONFIRMED ‚úÖ
```

**This suggests one of three scenarios**:
1. ‚úÖ Email WAS received and clicked within 28 seconds
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Supabase has auto-confirm enabled (skips email requirement)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Email confirmation is disabled in Auth settings

### Finding #3: Custom Email Logs Empty
- Our `email_logs` table exists but shows no confirmation emails
- This is expected - **Supabase's built-in Auth emails don't use our custom email system**
- Supabase handles signup confirmations separately from our Resend integration

## üîß Possible Issues

### Issue A: Email Confirmation Disabled in Supabase
**Most Likely Cause**: Supabase Auth might have email confirmation disabled

**How to Check**:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cafugvuaatsgihrsmvvl/auth/providers
2. Click on **Email** provider
3. Check these settings:
   - **Confirm email**: Should be **enabled** ‚úÖ
   - **Secure email change**: Should be **enabled** ‚úÖ
   - **Double confirm email changes**: Optional

**If "Confirm email" is disabled**:
- Users are auto-confirmed on signup
- No confirmation email is sent
- This would explain the 28-second "confirmation"

### Issue B: Email Going to Spam
**Check**:
- Spam/junk folder for confirmation email
- Promotions tab (if Gmail)
- Email filters that might be catching it

### Issue C: Supabase Email Service Rate Limiting
**Symptoms**:
- Free tier has email rate limits
- During development, limits can be hit quickly
- Emails queue but may not send immediately

**How to Check**:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cafugvuaatsgihrsmvvl/logs/edge-logs
2. Look for email-related errors
3. Check for rate limiting messages

### Issue D: Email Templates Not Configured
**Check**:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cafugvuaatsgihrsmvvl/auth/templates
2. Verify **Confirm signup** template exists
3. Check template uses correct variables and URLs

## üêõ Known Supabase Email Issues

### Issue: Auth Emails Use Separate System
- Supabase Auth emails (signup, password reset) use their built-in email service
- Our custom emails (invoices, reservations) use Resend API
- These are completely separate systems
- Configuration must be correct in **both** places

### Issue: Free Tier Email Limits
- Supabase free tier limits email sending
- Development testing can hit these limits
- Emails may queue or get dropped

### Issue: Email Provider Blocking
- Some email providers block automated emails
- Supabase's sending domain might be blocked
- Gmail/Outlook sometimes mark as spam

## üîß Workarounds

3. Click user ‚Üí Click "Confirm user" button
4. User can now log in without email confirmation

### Workaround B: Disable Email Confirmation (DEV ONLY)

2. Disable "Confirm email"
3. Users auto-confirm on signup
4. **Re-enable before production launch**

## üéØ Next Steps

**Please check and report back**:

1. **What email address did you use for testing?**
   - So I can search for it in the database

2. **Check Supabase Auth ‚Üí Email Provider Settings**:
   - Is "Confirm email" enabled or disabled?
   - Screenshot would be helpful

3. **Check spam folder** for the test email
   - Sometimes takes 1-2 minutes to arrive

4. **Check Auth logs** for any error messages
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cafugvuaatsgihrsmvvl/logs/edge-logs

Once we know these answers, I can provide the exact fix needed.

## üí° Most Likely Cause

Based on the data:
- **Hypothesis**: Email confirmation is disabled in Supabase Auth settings
- **Evidence**: User was "confirmed" 28 seconds after creation
- **Solution**: Enable "Confirm email" in Auth provider settings

**OR**

- **Hypothesis**: Email is being sent but going to spam
- **Evidence**: `confirmation_sent_at` is populated (Supabase says it sent it)
- **Solution**: Check spam folder, whitelist Supabase sending domain
