## üé® UI/UX Patterns & Design Language

### Visual Design:

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary Blue**: #4A9FD8 (top navigation, active states, primary buttons)
- **White/Light Gray**: Clean content backgrounds
- **Dark Gray**: #3A3F47 (left sidebar)
- **Green**: Success indicators, "ready" states, checkmarks
- **Orange**: Selected/active rows, current routine highlighting
- **Red**: Notifications badge, errors, alerts
- **Yellow**: Warning states (gold in "Powered by DanceComp Genie" footer)

**Typography:**
- **Headers**: Sans-serif, likely Arial or similar web-safe font
- **Body text**: Standard sans-serif
- **Font sizes**: Hierarchical (page titles > section headers > table headers > body)

**Layout Patterns:**
- **Left sidebar navigation** (200px fixed width) - Module hierarchy
- **Top navigation bar** (60px height) - Global actions and utilities
- **Breadcrumb navigation** - Shows page context (e.g., "Tabulation / Tabulation / Back")
- **Content area** - Fluid width, responds to sidebar state
- **Modal overlays** - For quick actions (Award Statistics, Session creation)
- **Tab navigation** - For related content (My Registrations, Move Registrations, etc.)

### Interaction Patterns:

**Tables:**
- Sortable columns (likely)
- Row selection highlighting (orange background for active row)
- Action buttons per row (Edit, Delete, View, etc.)
- Bulk actions via checkboxes
- Inline editing capabilities

**Filtering:**
- Multi-select dropdowns with "All" option
- Cascading filters (Year ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Studio)
- Filter persistence across page navigation
- "Reset" functionality visible in some views

**Buttons:**
- **Primary actions**: Solid blue background, white text
- **Secondary actions**: White/light gray background, dark text, border
- **Danger actions**: Red background (Delete, Scratch)
- **Success actions**: Green background (Save, Approve, Publish)
- **Button groups**: Horizontal rows for related actions

**Forms:**
- Label-above-input pattern
- Dropdown selectors for constrained choices
- Text inputs for free-form entry
- Checkbox/radio for binary/multiple choice
- Date/time pickers for temporal data

**Navigation:**
- **Expandable sidebar sections** (‚ñº arrows indicate collapsed/expanded state)
- **Breadcrumbs** for context awareness
- **Tab navigation** for related views
- **Back buttons** for wizard workflows

**Feedback:**
- **Green checkmarks**: Success/completion indicators
- **Red badges**: Notification counts (bell icon shows "5")
- **Modal alerts**: For confirmations and quick info
- **Toast notifications**: (implied by "App Sync is ON" button style)

### Data Presentation:

**Tables:**
- Alternating row colors (subtle gray/white)
- Column headers with sort indicators
- Fixed header on scroll (likely)
- Responsive column widths
- Truncation with ellipsis for long text

**Lists:**
- Clean, scannable format
- Hierarchical indentation for nested items
- Icon indicators for status (‚úì, ‚Ä¢, ‚ö†)

**Cards/Panels:**
- White background with subtle border/shadow
- Consistent padding (15-20px)
- Clear section headers
- Logical content grouping

### Responsive Behavior:

**Desktop-first design:**
- Fixed sidebar (200px)
- Fluid content area
- Table horizontal scroll on narrow viewports
- Modal overlays scale to viewport

**Likely mobile adaptations** (not visible in screenshots):
- Collapsible sidebar to hamburger menu
- Stacked table layouts or horizontal scroll
- Touch-optimized button sizes
- Simplified filtering interfaces

### Accessibility Considerations:

**Observable patterns:**
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Adequate color contrast (blue on white, dark text on light backgrounds)
- Icon + text labels for actions
- Keyboard navigation support (implied by standard form controls)
- Focus states on interactive elements

**Potential gaps:**
- No visible screen reader hints
- Unclear ARIA labeling
- Color as sole indicator in some cases (green checkmarks)

1. üî¥ **Live Tabulation Interface** (Months 1-2)
2. üî¥ **Reporting Suite** (Months 2-3)
3. üü° **Content Publishing** (Month 4)
4. üü° **Multi-Location** (Month 5)
5. üü° **Advanced Registration** (Month 3)

## üî¨ Technical Architecture Recommendations

### Backend Enhancements Needed:

**1. Tabulation Engine Improvements**
```typescript
// Add real-time tabulation views
interface TabulationView {
  id: string;
  competition_id: string;
  session_id: string;
  scored_routines: ScoredRoutine[];
  unscored_routines: UnscoredRoutine[];
  award_stats: AwardStatistics;
  placements: Placement[];
  ties: TieDetection[];
}

// Real-time subscription
const { data: tabulationData } = trpc.tabulation.subscribe.useQuery({
  competition_id: competitionId,
  session_id: sessionId,
});
```

**2. Reporting Infrastructure**
```typescript
// Report generation service
interface ReportGenerator {
  generateReport(type: ReportType, filters: ReportFilters): Promise<ReportOutput>;
  getAvailableReports(): ReportDefinition[];
  previewReport(type: ReportType, filters: ReportFilters): Promise<string>;
}

// Support multiple output formats
type ReportFormat = 'pdf' | 'excel' | 'csv' | 'xml';
```

**3. Multi-Location Data Model**
```typescript
// Extend Competition schema
interface Competition {
  // ... existing fields
  parent_tour_id?: string; // Link to tour
  location_order: number;
  early_bird_deadline?: Date;
  region?: string;
  is_active: boolean;
}

interface Tour {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  year: number;
  locations: Competition[];
  settings: TourSettings;
}
```

**4. Content Publishing System**
```typescript
interface PublishableContent {
  id: string;
  type: 'schedule' | 'scores' | 'results' | 'program' | 'videos';
  competition_id: string;
  publish_targets: ('website' | 'app' | 'dashboard')[];
  publish_after?: Date;
  is_published: boolean;
  public_url?: string;
}

// Publishing service
interface ContentPublisher {
  publish(content: PublishableContent, targets: PublishTarget[]): Promise<void>;
  preview(content: PublishableContent): Promise<string>;
  notify(recipients: string[], content: PublishableContent): Promise<void>;
}
```
