## ‚ö†Ô∏è GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Space Limit Enforcement ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSING

**Issue**: System does NOT prevent exceeding confirmed spaces
**Severity**: üü° **MEDIUM** (Should Have for MVP)
**Current Behavior**:
- Reservation approved for 10 spaces
- Created 3 routines (3/10 used)
- No counter visible showing "3 of 10 spaces used"
- No validation preventing creation of 11th routine

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Display space counter: "3 of 10 spaces used" on entries page
2. Validate on routine creation: Block if limit reached
3. Show clear error: "You have used all 10 confirmed spaces for this competition"

**Recommended Fix** (3-4 hours):
```typescript
// In entryRouter.create mutation
const reservation = await prisma.reservations.findFirst({
  where: {
    studio_id: input.studioId,
    competition_id: input.competitionId,
    status: 'approved'
  }
});

if (!reservation) {
  throw new Error('No approved reservation found for this competition');
}

const existingEntries = await prisma.competition_entries.count({
  where: {
    studio_id: input.studioId,
    competition_id: input.competitionId,
    status: { not: 'cancelled' }
  }
});

if (existingEntries >= reservation.spaces_confirmed) {
  throw new Error(
    `Space limit reached. You have ${reservation.spaces_confirmed} confirmed spaces and have created ${existingEntries} routines.`
  );
}
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/server/routers/entry.ts` - Add validation
- `src/app/dashboard/entries/page.tsx` - Add counter UI

---

### 2. Reservation Status Visibility (SD View) ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS POLISH

**Issue**: Approved reservation needs clearer "Create Routines" CTA
**Severity**: üîµ **LOW** (Nice to Have)
**Current Behavior**:
- Approved reservations show green APPROVED badge
- Shows capacity: "10/10 confirmed"
- Shows "Competition Entries: 0 / 10" with hourglass icon
- No prominent CTA to create routines

**Expected Behavior**:
- Large "Create Routines" button for approved reservations
- Prominent display: "3 of 10 spaces used - 7 remaining"
- Quick link to entries page pre-filtered to this competition

**Recommended Fix** (2-3 hours):
```tsx
{reservation.status === 'approved' && (
  <Link
    href={`/dashboard/entries/create?competition=${reservation.competition_id}`}
    className="px-6 py-3 bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 rounded-lg"
  >
    ‚ûï Create Routines ({reservation.entries_count} / {reservation.spaces_confirmed} used)
  </Link>
)}
```
