## ‚ùì GAPS TO VERIFY (Need Testing)

### Critical Workflow Connections

**1. Reservation ‚Üí Routine Conversion Workflow** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Question**: When CD approves reservation, can SD immediately create routines?
- **Test Needed**:
  1. SD creates reservation
  2. CD approves with confirmed spaces
  3. SD should now see "Create Routines" enabled
  4. SD creates routines up to confirmed space count
- **Likely Status**: Should work (we have both pieces), but needs end-to-end test

**2. Routine Categories Completeness** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Question**: Are all 7 category types fully functional in routine creation?
- **Test Needed**: Create routine and verify all dropdowns populate from competition settings
- **Likely Status**: Should work (settings page complete), but needs verification

**3. Space/Token Management** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Question**: Does system enforce confirmed space limits?
- **Test Needed**:
  1. CD approves reservation with 10 spaces
  2. SD tries to create 11th routine
  3. System should prevent or warn
- **Backend**: Competition has `available_reservation_tokens` field
- **Status**: UNKNOWN - may need validation logic

**4. Studio Approval Before Reservation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Competitor Insight**: Both DCG and CompetitionHQ require studio approval before reservations
- **Question**: Do we have studio approval workflow?
- **Current**: Seems to allow any studio to create reservations immediately
- **Recommended**: May need studio approval step (but could be post-MVP)

## üîß POTENTIAL MVP GAPS (3-Day Priority)

### Priority 1: MUST HAVE (Blocking MVP)

**None identified** - Core workflows appear complete!

### Priority 2: SHOULD HAVE (Enhances MVP)

**1. Space Limit Enforcement** üü°
- **Issue**: Need to validate SD can't exceed confirmed spaces
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Implementation**:
  - Add validation in `entryRouter.create`
  - Check reservation.spaces_confirmed vs existing entry count
  - Return clear error message if exceeded

**2. Reservation Status Visibility** üü°
- **Issue**: SD needs clear UI showing approved reservations before creating routines
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Implementation**:
  - Update `/dashboard/reservations` page for SD view
  - Show "Create Routines" button only for approved reservations
  - Display confirmed space count prominently

**3. Entry Limit Counter** üü°
- **Issue**: SD should see "5 of 10 spaces used" when creating routines
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours
- **Implementation**:
  - Add counter to entries list page
  - Show remaining spaces
  - Disable "Create Entry" when limit reached

### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Can defer post-MVP)

**1. Studio Approval Workflow** ‚ö™
- **Effort**: 1 day
- **Defer**: Post-MVP (competitor insight, not blocking)

**2. Bulk Reservation Approval** ‚ö™
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Defer**: Post-MVP (CD can approve one-by-one for now)

**3. Email Notifications** ‚ö™
- **Effort**: 1 day
- **Defer**: Post-MVP (have email infrastructure at `/dashboard/emails`)
