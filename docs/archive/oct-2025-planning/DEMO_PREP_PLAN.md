# Demo Prep Plan - Tuesday Demo

**Created:** 2025-10-24 (11pm EST)
**Demo Date:** Tuesday (2 days)
**Status:** In Progress

---

## 🎯 Primary Objective

**RELIABILITY over NEW FEATURES**

Ensure all 20+ features built in the last 9 hours work flawlessly end-to-end.

---

## 📋 Monday Focus (6-8 hours)

### 1. ✅ Build Test Data Seed Script (CRITICAL) - 2-3 hours
**Why:** 72% of tests blocked by missing data
**Deliverable:** Automated script that creates:
- Complete studio registration
- Approved reservation with 15 spaces
- 12 confirmed routines + 3 draft routines
- Enables verification of ALL core features

**Files to create:**
- `scripts/seed-demo-data.ts` or similar
- Can be run on both staging and production

### 2. ✅ Execute Full Workflow Test - 1-2 hours
**Test Flow:**
1. SD creates reservation → CD approves
2. SD adds 15 routines → SD submits summary (12 confirmed, 3 draft)
3. Verify auto-close with token refund (3 tokens back)
4. CD generates invoice
5. CD sends invoice (verify lock + email)
6. CD marks invoice PAID (verify lock)
7. Check email notifications at each step

**Deliverable:** `WORKFLOW_TEST_RESULTS.md` with screenshots

### 3. ✅ Fix Late Fee PDF Display - 15 min
**Why:** Already in CSV, just missing in PDF
**File:** `src/lib/pdf-reports.ts`
**Impact:** Professional completeness

### 4. ✅ Add Unified "Approve & Send Invoice" Button - 30 min
**Why:** Big UX win, combines 2 clicks into 1
**File:** `src/components/ReservationPipeline.tsx` or invoice page
**Impact:** CD workflow efficiency

### 5. ⏭️ OPTIONAL: Polish Scheduling Suite - 2-3 hours
**Only if time permits**
- Test schedule-builder page thoroughly
- Ensure drag-drop works smoothly
- Verify conflict detection
- High wow factor for demo

---

## 📋 Tuesday Morning (2 hours before demo)

### 1. ✅ Final Smoke Test on Production
- Login as CD and SD
- Execute critical path (reserve → approve → invoice → pay)
- Verify email delivery via Resend dashboard

### 2. ✅ Create Demo Script
**Exact steps to follow:**
1. Show studio dashboard (SD view)
2. Create reservation for EMPWR Dance - London
3. Switch to CD view
4. Approve reservation
5. Switch back to SD
6. Add 12 routines, submit summary
7. Switch to CD
8. Generate and send invoice
9. Show branded PDF
10. Mark invoice as PAID
11. Show email notifications in Resend

### 3. ✅ Pre-seed Demo Data
- Fresh competition with clean data
- Test studio ready to go
- No errors or edge cases visible

### 4. ✅ Test Forgot Password Flow
- One more verification that it works
- Have backup plan if email delayed

## 💡 What to Show in Demo

### **SHOW:**
1. ✅ **Complete reservation flow** - SD request → CD approval → invoice → payment

3. ✅ **Professional branded invoices** - PDF with competition branding
4. ✅ **Email notifications** - Resend dashboard showing delivery
5. ✅ **Invoice locking** - Sent/Paid invoices can't be modified
6. ✅ **Forgot password** - Self-service account recovery

### **AVOID:**
- ❌ Scheduling suite (unless 100% stable)
- ❌ Admin testing tools (unless asked)
- ❌ Backend technical details

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Demo

### Must Work Flawlessly:
1. ✅ Studio login
2. ✅ Create reservation
3. ✅ CD approval with token deduction
4. ✅ Add routines
5. ✅ Submit summary (auto-close if needed)
6. ✅ Generate invoice
7. ✅ Send invoice (lock + email)
8. ✅ Mark PAID (lock)
9. ✅ Forgot password

### Nice to Have Working:
1. ⏭️ Drag-drop scheduling
2. ⏭️ Conflict detection
3. ⏭️ CSV export with all fields

## 📈 Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items (Test Thoroughly):
1. **Email delivery** - Verify Resend working in production
2. **Token calculations** - Ensure refunds calculate correctly
3. **Invoice locking** - Must prevent edits after send/pay
4. **Auto-close logic** - Test edge cases (0 routines, all routines, partial)

### Backup Plans:
1. If emails fail → Show Resend dashboard logs
2. If auto-close bugs → Manually demonstrate the concept
3. If invoice PDF breaks → Show working version from staging
4. If production breaks → Have staging ready as backup
