# Advanced Scheduling Suite - Implementation Summary

**Session Date:** 2025-10-24
**Context Used:** ~85k / 200k tokens
**Status:** ✅ Core Implementation Complete, ⏳ Build Testing

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**New Tables:**
- `schedules` - Master schedule container (draft/locked status)
- `schedule_items` - Routines + break cards with positioning
- `schedule_conflicts` - Auto-detected conflicts (back-to-back dancers)
- `schedule_suggestions` - SD change requests for CD review

**Schema Location:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (models added at lines 1321-1424)
- `prisma/migrations/20250124_add_scheduling_suite/migration.sql`

**Key Fields:**
- `schedule_items.routine_number` (100-999, temporary in draft mode)
- `competition_entries.routine_number` (permanent after lock)
- `schedule_items.item_type` ('routine' | 'break')
- `schedule_items.break_type` ('lunch' | 'break' | 'awards')

---

### 2. tRPC API Router ✅

**File:** `src/server/routers/scheduleBuilder.ts` (548 lines)

**Endpoints:**
- `getByCompetition` - Fetch full schedule with conflicts & suggestions
- `create` - Create new draft schedule
- `autoGenerate` - Auto-generate from confirmed entries
- `lock` - Lock schedule (copy routine numbers to entries)
- `addItem` / `updateItem` / `deleteItem` - CRUD for schedule items
- `reorderItems` - Bulk update for drag-drop
- `detectConflicts` - Run conflict detection algorithm
- `createSuggestion` - SD creates change request
- `reviewSuggestion` - CD approves/rejects suggestions

**Access Control:**
- CD/Super Admin only for editing
- Future: SD access for viewing and suggestions

---

### 3. UI Components ✅

**Page:** `src/app/dashboard/admin/schedule-builder/page.tsx`
- Day/Session selector (1-4 days, 1-4 sessions per day)
- Auto-generate button
- Detect conflicts button
- Lock schedule button
- Suggestions review panel

**Components:** `src/components/schedule/`
- `ScheduleRoutineCard.tsx` - Draggable routine with dancers, category, routine#
- `ScheduleBreakCard.tsx` - Draggable break (lunch/break/awards)
- `ConflictPanel.tsx` - Sidebar showing conflicts by severity
- `SuggestionsPanel.tsx` - Modal for CD to review SD suggestions
- `ScheduleDay.tsx` - Placeholder for future features

---

### 4. Conflict Detection Engine ✅

**Algorithm:** `detectConflicts` mutation (lines 425-489 in scheduleBuilder.ts)

**Rules Implemented:**
- **Back-to-Back Dancers (Critical):** Dancer in < 2 routines apart
- **Close Appearances (Warning):** Dancer in < 3 routines apart (needs costume change time)

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
{
  conflict_type: "back_to_back_dancer",
  entry_ids: ["entry1_id", "entry2_id"],
  dancer_ids: ["dancer_id"],
  severity: "critical" | "warning" | "info",
  description: "Dancer appears in routines with only 1 routine(s) in between"
}
```

---

### 5. Routine Number Logic ✅

**Draft Mode:**
- Auto-assigned sequentially starting at 100
- Stored only in `schedule_items.routine_number`
- Can be reassigned when routines are moved

**Locked Mode:**
- CD clicks "Lock Schedule"
- Routine numbers copied to `competition_entries.routine_number` (denormalized)
- Numbers become permanent even if routine is moved later
- Example: Routine "Tap to the Sky" is #105 forever

**Use Case:**
- Programs/schedules printed with routine #105
- If CD later moves #105 to different time slot, number stays the same
- Studios/dancers/judges always reference #105

---

### 6. Auto-Generation Logic (Placeholder) ✅

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// Sort entries by: size → category → age
// Assign routine# 100, 101, 102...
// Place 20 routines per session
// Add awards ceremony (30min) after every 20 routines
// 4 sessions per day, up to 4 days
```

**Future:** User will provide complex logic rules for:
- Entry size ordering (solos first, groups later)
- Category blocks (all jazz together)
- Age division placement
- Minimum gaps between same dancers
- Break timing preferences

## Build Status

**Test 1:** ✅ Passed (Prisma schema compiles)
**Test 2:** ❌ Failed (Missing `@/lib/trpc/client` import)
**Test 3:** ❌ Failed (TypeScript error: implicit any)
**Test 4:** ⏳ Running (Fixed import + types)

**Remaining Issues:**
- May need to install `@dnd-kit` dependencies (`@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities`)
- Check if already in `package.json`, if not: `npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities`

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (To Make Functional)

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
   ```

2. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Option A: Use Supabase MCP to run `migration.sql`
   - Option B: Manual Prisma migrate (requires `.env` with DB credentials)

3. **Fix Build** (if test 4 fails)
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Fix any remaining TypeScript errors

### Short-Term (Within Next Session)

4. **Add Break Card Toolbar**
   - Draggable templates for lunch/break/awards
   - Click to add to timeline

5. **Manual Routine Number Edit**
   - Input field on routine card
   - Override auto-assigned numbers

6. **Time Calculation**
   - Auto-calculate `start_time` from running order + durations
   - Display estimated session end times

7. **SD Sandbox Interface**
   - `/dashboard/schedule-suggest?competitionId=<id>`
   - Drag-drop with submit button
   - Format suggestions as structured data

### Medium-Term (Later Sessions)

8. **Schedule Export (PDF/CSV)**
9. **Search/Filter routines**
10. **Undo/Redo for drag-drop**
11. **Multi-select drag**
12. **Schedule templates**

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Drag-Drop Library
**Choice:** `@dnd-kit`
**Rationale:** Modern, accessible, TypeScript-first, works with React 18+
**Alternative:** `react-beautiful-dnd` (older, more battle-tested)

### 2. Router Naming
**Choice:** `scheduleBuilder` router (not `schedule`)
**Rationale:** Existing `scheduling` router already exists for different purpose

### 3. Data Denormalization
**Choice:** Copy routine_number to `competition_entries` when locked
**Rationale:**
- Fast lookups without joining `schedule_items`
- Preserves routine# even if schedule is rebuilt
- Trade-off: Potential data inconsistency if not careful

### 4. Conflict Detection
**Choice:** On-demand via button click (not real-time)
**Rationale:**
- O(n²) algorithm can be slow for 500+ routines
- Real-time would require debouncing/throttling
- Explicit check gives CD control

### 5. Break Cards
**Choice:** Same table as routines (`schedule_items`)
**Rationale:**
- Unified drag-drop interface
- Same positioning fields (day/session/running_order)
- Discriminated by `item_type` field

---

## User Experience Flow

### Example: Scheduling a 2-Day Competition

1. **CD logs in** → Navigates to Director Panel
2. **Clicks "Schedule Builder"** → Selects competition "EMPWR Dance London"
3. **Clicks "Auto-Generate"**
   - System fetches 150 confirmed entries
   - Sorts by size (solos → duos → trios → groups)
   - Assigns routine #100-#249
   - Places across 2 days, 3 sessions per day
   - Adds awards ceremonies after each session

4. **CD reviews Day 1, Session 1**
   - Sees 25 routines
   - Notices two back-to-back solos with same dancer
   - Drags one routine down 5 spots
   - Routine numbers stay the same (still #105 and #108)

5. **CD clicks "Detect Conflicts"**
   - System finds 0 critical conflicts ✅
   - 2 warnings about close appearances (acceptable)

6. **SD receives draft schedule** (via email or dashboard)
   - Views their studio's 12 routines
   - Sees routine #145 is late in day (8 PM)
   - Submits suggestion: "Move #145 to morning session"
   - Adds note: "Dancer has school next day"

7. **CD reviews suggestions**
   - Sees 3 pending suggestions from different studios
   - Approves 2, rejects 1 (would cause conflict)
   - Manually adjusts schedule based on approved suggestions

8. **CD clicks "Lock Schedule"** (10 days before event)
   - Routine numbers copied to `competition_entries` table
   - Status changes to "Locked"
   - SDs notified of final schedule

9. **Day of competition**
   - Programs printed with routine #100-#249
   - CD realizes #175 needs to move due to injury
   - Moves #175 to end of day
   - Routine stays #175 on all printed materials ✅

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No real-time collaboration** - Multiple CDs could conflict
2. **No undo/redo** - Mistakes require manual reversal
3. **No keyboard shortcuts** - Drag-drop only via mouse
4. **No mobile support** - Desktop only for now
5. **No schedule versioning** - Can't compare draft versions
6. **Placeholder auto-gen logic** - User must provide real rules
7. **No pagination** - May be slow for 500+ routines
8. **No time validation** - Can schedule impossible timelines

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create schedule for competition with 50 entries
- [ ] Auto-generate and verify sequential routine numbers (100-149)
- [ ] Drag routine from Day 1 to Day 2
- [ ] Add break card (lunch, 30 min)
- [ ] Detect conflicts with back-to-back dancer
- [ ] Lock schedule and verify `competition_entries.routine_number` populated
- [ ] Unlock and verify denormalized data still intact
- [ ] Submit SD suggestion
- [ ] Review and approve suggestion as CD
- [ ] Export schedule (once implemented)

### Edge Cases to Test

- [ ] Empty competition (0 entries)
- [ ] Single entry
- [ ] 500+ entries (performance)
- [ ] Dancer in 10+ routines (many conflicts)
- [ ] Locking schedule twice
- [ ] Deleting locked schedule
- [ ] Moving routine after lock (number should stay)
