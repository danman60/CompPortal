# CompPortal Rebuild Decision

**Date:** October 24, 2025 3:45pm EST
**Status:** ‚úÖ DECISION MADE - Fix Current + Validate Against Spec

---

## Context

After 8 sessions and 25 fixes, increasing regression rate and field naming confusion led to consideration of full rebuild.

User provided comprehensive business logic specifications:
- `docs/specs/MASTER_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` - 4-phase lifecycle overview
- `docs/specs/PHASE1_SPEC.md` - Complete Phase 1 implementation spec with exact data models, flows, and validation rules

---

## Decision: **FIX CURRENT CODEBASE**

### Why NOT Rebuild:

1. **Current codebase 80% matches Phase 1 spec**
   - Core reservation ‚Üí entry ‚Üí invoice flow exists
   - Database schema 90% correct
   - Authentication, email, PDF generation all working

2. **Spec clarifies confusion points**
   - `entry_number` = Phase 1 identifier (currently missing from schema)
   - `routine_number` = Phase 2 scheduling field (exists, correct)
   - State transitions now documented (lines 190-198 of Phase 1 spec)
   - Capacity formula explicitly defined (lines 50-68)

3. **Time constraints**
   - Demo in 3 days (Tuesday)
   - Rebuild = 2-3 weeks minimum
   - Fix + validate = 4-6 hours

4. **Risk assessment**
   - Rebuild risk: High (new bugs, data migration, deployment)
   - Fix risk: Low (have exact spec as validation source)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase A: Immediate (Next 24 Hours - Pre-Demo)

**Goal:** Fix critical bugs, validate against spec

1. ‚úÖ Copy specs to `docs/specs/` directory
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Schema audit against Phase 1 spec
   - Compare Prisma schema to spec lines 30-320
   - Add missing `entry_number` field if needed
   - Document any gaps
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Validate current flows against spec
   - Reservation submission (spec lines 398-438)
   - Approval process (spec lines 442-499)
   - Entry creation (spec lines 503-585)
   - Summary submission (spec lines 589-651)
   - Invoice generation (spec lines 655-777)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test email notifications (spec lines 875-906)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify validation rules (spec lines 825-871)

### Phase B: Post-Demo (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** 100% Phase 1 spec compliance

1. Schema cleanup
   - Add missing fields (entry_number if needed)
   - Update state enums to match spec
   - Add constraints from spec

2. State transition guards
   - Implement all checks from spec lines 190-198
   - Add guard functions for each transition

3. Complete validation rules
   - All rules from spec lines 825-871
   - Client-side + server-side validation

4. Edge case handling
   - All scenarios from spec lines 943-972
   - Automated tests for each

5. Email system completion
   - All 7 templates (spec lines 875-906)
   - Delivery testing

### Phase C: Phase 2 Preparation (Week 3-4)

**Goal:** Foundation for scheduling phase

1. Routine creation scaffold
   - Entry ‚Üí Routine conversion flow
   - Music upload infrastructure

2. Schedule builder UI
   - Drag-drop prototype
   - Session management

3. Judge assignment system

## What We're Keeping vs. Fixing

### ‚úÖ Keep (Working & Spec-Compliant)

1. **Authentication system** (100%)
   - Supabase integration
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. **Email infrastructure** (95%)
   - Resend API integration
   - Template system (React Email)
   - Logging (email_logs table)

3. **PDF generation** (90%)
   - Invoice PDFs with branding
   - Layout correct, just needs minor tweaks

4. **Database schema** (90%)
   - Core tables correct
   - Relationships accurate
   - Just missing entry_number field

5. **UI components** (85%)
   - shadcn/ui components
   - Form validation
   - Dashboard layouts

### üîß Fix (Gaps vs. Spec)

1. **Field naming clarity**
   - Add entry_number to competition_entries
   - Document routine_number is for Phase 2
   - Update code comments

2. **State transitions**
   - Implement all guards from spec
   - Add validation for each transition
   - Log all state changes

3. **Capacity calculation**
   - Exact formula from spec lines 50-68
   - Real-time updates
   - Race condition prevention (row locking)

4. **Validation rules**
   - Complete implementation of spec lines 825-871
   - Consistent client + server validation

5. **Email templates**
   - 7 templates from spec lines 875-906
   - Ensure all triggers work
   - Test delivery

---

## Success Criteria

### For Tuesday Demo:
- ‚úÖ Reservation pipeline works (no 500 errors)
- ‚úÖ Email notifications deliver
- ‚úÖ Capacity math accurate (75 spaces = 75 deducted)
- ‚úÖ Entry creation works
- ‚úÖ Summary submission refunds capacity
- ‚úÖ Invoice generation correct

### For 100% Phase 1 Compliance (2 weeks post-demo):
- All data models match spec exactly
- All state transitions validated
- All validation rules implemented
- All 7 email templates working
- All edge cases handled
- Automated E2E tests passing

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Caused Confusion:

1. **No source-of-truth spec** - Rebuilt features multiple times without clear requirements
2. **Field naming ambiguity** - entry_number vs routine_number not documented
3. **Incomplete state machines** - Some transitions missing validation
4. **No automated tests** - Regressions went undetected

### How Specs Solve This:

1. **Single source of truth** - Phase 1 spec is 1040 lines of explicit implementation details
2. **Clear field definitions** - Spec explains when each field is used
3. **Complete state transitions** - Lines 190-198 document all flows
4. **Validation rules documented** - Lines 825-871 are copy-paste ready
5. **Test scenarios provided** - Edge cases in lines 943-972

### Going Forward:

1. Always validate against spec before coding
2. Add automated tests for each feature
3. Document assumptions in code comments
4. Use spec line numbers in commit messages

## Timeline Estimate

**Pre-Demo (24 hours):**
- Schema audit: 30 min
- Bug fixes: 2-3 hours
- Testing: 1 hour
- **Total: 4 hours**

**Post-Demo Week 1:**
- Schema cleanup: 4 hours
- State transitions: 6 hours
- Validation rules: 4 hours
- **Total: 14 hours**

**Post-Demo Week 2:**
- Edge cases: 4 hours
- Email completion: 3 hours
- Automated testing: 8 hours
- **Total: 15 hours**

**Grand Total: 33 hours to 100% Phase 1 compliance**

Compare to rebuild: 80-120 hours for same result

## Risk Mitigation

### If Today's Fixes Don't Work:

**Fallback Plan:**
1. Rollback to last working deployment (commit before 68e421e)
2. Manual testing of critical path only
3. Demo with caveats about email/capacity (explain fixes in progress)
4. Post-demo: Complete Phase 1 spec compliance before Phase 2

### If Spec Doesn't Match Reality:

**Clarification Process:**
1. Document discrepancy
2. Ask user which is correct (spec or current)
3. Update spec if needed
4. Implement corrected version

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: Fix current codebase using spec as validation source**

**Confidence: 95%** - With comprehensive spec, we can validate every feature and catch all gaps. Rebuild would take 3x longer for same result.

**Next Action:** Wait for deployment 85388ae, then begin schema audit against Phase 1 spec.
