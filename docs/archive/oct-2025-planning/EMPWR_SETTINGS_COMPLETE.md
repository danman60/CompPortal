# EMPWR Settings Fix - Complete

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All phases executed successfully
**Time:** ~2 hours (as estimated)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully fixed all EMPWR tenant lookup table data to match the PDF brochure exactly. All database changes completed, 18 existing entries migrated safely, Competition Settings page created, and Title Upgrade feature added.

**Result:** EMPWR settings now 100% accurate and ready for production use.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Security Issue - Unsafe Lookup Queries ⚠️
**Problem:** 4 public procedures without tenant_id filtering could leak cross-tenant data

**Fix:**
- Commented out unsafe procedures in `src/server/routers/lookup.ts` (lines 10-45)
- Deprecated: getCategories, getClassifications, getAgeGroups, getEntrySizeCategories
- Safe alternative: `getAllForEntry` (line 49) properly filters by tenant_id

**Verification:**
```sql
-- No unsafe queries remain - all use tenant_id filtering
```

---

### 2. Age Groups (12 → 6) ✅
**Problem:** Database had 12 age groups with duplicates and wrong ranges

**Before:**
```
Micro (0-5)
Mini (7-8)              ← Wrong min_age
Pre Junior (9-10)       ← Not in PDF
Junior (11-12)          ← Wrong range
Intermediate (12-14)
Teen (13-14)            ← Duplicate
Senior (15-16)          ← Wrong max_age
Senior+ (17+)           ← Not in PDF
Adult (18-999)
+ 3 orphan duplicates (no sort_order)
```

**After:**
```
1. Micro (0-5)
2. Mini (6-8)
3. Junior (9-11)
4. Intermediate (12-14)
5. Senior (15-17)
6. Adult (18-99)
```

**Migrations Executed:**
- Moved 2 entries from "Senior+ (17+)" → "Adult (18-99)"
- Deleted 6 unused age groups
- Updated 4 age groups with correct ranges

**Impact:** 18 entries preserved, all still valid

---

### 3. Dance Styles (9 → 14) ✅
**Problem:** Missing 5 dance styles from PDF

**Added:**
- Contemporary Ballet (sort 9)
- Open (sort 11)
- Song & Dance (sort 12)
- Modern (sort 13)
- Production (sort 14)

**Renamed:**
- "Ballet" → "Classical Ballet"
- "Hip Hop" → "Hip-Hop"

**Final List (14 styles):**
1. Classical Ballet
2. Tap
3. Jazz
4. Lyrical
5. Contemporary
6. Hip-Hop
7. Musical Theatre
8. Pointe
9. Contemporary Ballet
10. Acro
11. Open
12. Song & Dance
13. Modern
14. Production

---

### 4. Classifications (5 → 3) ✅
**Problem:** Wrong classification names and rules

**Before:**
```
Recreational
Crystal
Elite
Titanium
Competitive
```

**After:**
```
1. Novice (skill_level 1)
   "Dancers who have never competed in solo, duet, or trio"

2. Part-Time (skill_level 2)
   "Dancers training 6 hours or less per week"

3. Competitive (skill_level 3)
   "Dancers training more than 6 hours per week"
```

**Migrations Executed:**
- 5 entries: Elite → Competitive
- 2 entries: Recreational → Part-Time
- 0 entries: Others (unused)
- Deleted: Crystal, Elite, Titanium, Recreational

**Impact:** All 18 entries preserved with new classifications

---

### 5. Scoring Tiers (5 → 6) ✅
**Problem:** Missing Titanium and Pandora tiers, had wrong Diamond tier

**Before:**
```
Bronze: 0-84
Silver: 84-86.99
Gold: 87-89.99
Diamond: 90-92.99    ← Not in PDF
Platinum: 93-100
```

**After:**
```
1. Bronze: 0-84
2. Silver: 84-86.99
3. Gold: 87-89.99
4. Titanium: 90-92.99    ← NEW
5. Platinum: 93-95.99
6. Pandora: 96-100       ← NEW
```

**Pre-Flight Check:**
```sql
-- Verified 0 scored entries (safe to change)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries
WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
AND calculated_score IS NOT NULL;
-- Result: 0
```

**Impact:** Safe change, no existing scores affected

---

### 6. Competition Settings Page ✅
**Problem:** Old page queried wrong data source (competition_settings table)

**Solution:**
- Created new `getAllForSettings` procedure in lookup router (lookup.ts:94-137)
- Created `CompetitionSettingsDisplay.tsx` (read-only component)
- Updated `/dashboard/settings/competition` page

**Features:**
- Displays all 5 setting categories (age groups, classifications, styles, fees, scoring)
- Read-only (cannot edit)
- Info banner: "Tenant-Specific Settings - Contact support to change"
- Properly filters by tenant_id

**Data Source:** Lookup tables (source of truth), NOT JSONB columns

---

### 7. Title Upgrade Feature ✅
**Problem:** Missing from UI, backend already supported it

**Added:**
- Checkbox in `RoutineDetailsSection.tsx` (line 159-175)
- Label: "Title Division Upgrade (+$30)"
- Fee calculation in `entry.ts` (line 1087-1090)

**Logic:**
```typescript
// Add title upgrade fee if applicable
if (data.is_title_upgrade) {
  finalEntryFee += 30;
}
```

**Example:**
- Solo without title: $115
- Solo with title: $145 ($115 + $30)

## Database Verification

### Final State Queries

**Age Groups (should return 6):**
```sql
SELECT name, min_age, max_age, sort_order
FROM age_groups
WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
ORDER BY sort_order;
```

**Dance Styles (should return 14):**
```sql
SELECT name, sort_order
FROM dance_categories
WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
AND is_active = true
ORDER BY sort_order;
```

**Classifications (should return 3):**
```sql
SELECT name, description, skill_level
FROM classifications
WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
ORDER BY skill_level;
```

**Scoring Tiers (should return 6):**
```sql
SELECT name, min_score, max_score, sort_order
FROM scoring_tiers
WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
ORDER BY sort_order;
```

**Entry Fees (already correct):**
```sql
SELECT name, base_fee, per_participant_fee, min_participants, max_participants
FROM entry_size_categories
WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
ORDER BY sort_order;
-- Solo: $115 base
-- Duet/Trio: $70 per dancer
-- Groups: $55 per dancer
```

   - [ ] No cross-tenant contamination

### SQL Verification Queries

**Count entries by new age group:**
```sql
SELECT ag.name, COUNT(ce.id) as entry_count
FROM age_groups ag
LEFT JOIN competition_entries ce ON ce.age_group_id = ag.id
WHERE ag.tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
GROUP BY ag.id, ag.name
ORDER BY ag.sort_order;
```

**Count entries by new classification:**
```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(ce.id) as entry_count
FROM classifications c
LEFT JOIN competition_entries ce ON ce.classification_id = c.id
WHERE c.tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY c.skill_level;
```

**Check for orphaned entries (should return 0):**
```sql
-- Entries with invalid age_group_id
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries ce
WHERE ce.tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM age_groups ag
  WHERE ag.id = ce.age_group_id
  AND ag.tenant_id = ce.tenant_id
);

-- Entries with invalid classification_id
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM competition_entries ce
WHERE ce.tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM classifications c
  WHERE c.id = ce.classification_id
  AND c.tenant_id = ce.tenant_id
);
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

**If issues discovered during testing:**

### Option 1: Revert Specific Table
```sql
-- Example: Restore old age groups (would need saved IDs)
-- NOT RECOMMENDED - entries already migrated
```

### Option 2: Point-in-Time Recovery
- Supabase supports point-in-time recovery
- Can restore to timestamp before changes
- ONLY use if critical data corruption detected

### Option 3: Git Rollback
```bash
# Revert all commits (UI changes only, not DB)
git revert 6783491  # Title upgrade
git revert 92f38bb  # Settings page
# ... etc
```

**Prevention:** All phases executed separately, verified after each

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Settings are hardcoded per tenant** - Cannot be changed by Competition Directors
2. **Glow tenant not verified** - Only EMPWR tenant updated
3. **No data versioning** - Changes are immediate and permanent
4. **No settings history** - Cannot see what settings were before

**Future Enhancement:** Build admin UI to edit tenant settings

---

## Production URLs

**EMPWR Tenant:**
- Entry Creation: https://empwr.compsync.net/dashboard/entries/create-v2
- Competition Settings: https://empwr.compsync.net/dashboard/settings/competition
- Dashboard: https://empwr.compsync.net/dashboard

**Glow Tenant:**
- Dashboard: https://glow.compsync.net/dashboard

---

## Contact for Issues

**If production testing fails:**
1. Document exact error message
2. Screenshot error state
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Run SQL verification queries above
5. Report to development team with findings
