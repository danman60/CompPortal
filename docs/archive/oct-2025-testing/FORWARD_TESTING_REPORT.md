## New Bugs Discovered

### Bug #NEW-1: DD/MM/YYYY Date Format Not Supported (Priority: P2)
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** International users with DD/MM/YYYY date preference cannot import data
**Details:**
- Date format "15/03/2009" causes Prisma validation error

- Supported formats: MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MMM-YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD
- Unsupported: DD/MM/YYYY (common in Europe, Australia, etc.)
**Evidence:** `test_1.4_PARTIAL_4_of_5_mixed_dates.png`
**Recommendation:** Add date format auto-detection or configuration option

---

## Architectural Limitations (Studio Director Role)

### 1. No Reservation Edit Capability
**Feature:** Edit reservation details (routine count, consents)
**Status:** Not available to Studio Director
**Impact:** Cannot correct mistakes without contacting Competition Director
**Business Decision:** Likely intentional to maintain audit trail and approval workflow

### 2. No Reservation Cancellation
**Feature:** Cancel submitted reservation
**Status:** Not available to Studio Director
**Impact:** Must contact Competition Director to cancel
**Business Decision:** Likely intentional to prevent capacity manipulation

### 3. No Dancer Deletion
**Feature:** Delete dancer from roster
**Status:** Not available in UI
**Impact:** Cannot remove incorrectly created dancers
**Options:**
- Feature not yet implemented
- Intentionally restricted (soft delete only)
- May be available elsewhere in UI

### 4. Competition Filter Incomplete
**Feature:** Filter reservations by specific competition
**Status:** Dropdown exists but only shows "All Competitions"
**Impact:** Cannot filter when studio has multiple competitions
**Note:** May be conditional on having multiple active competitions

---

## Console Errors Observed

```
[WARNING] Unmatched CSV headers: [Extra Column 1, Random Data, Notes]
```
**Status:** Expected behavior, gracefully handled

### Test 1.4 (Invalid Date Format)

date_of_birth: new Date("Invalid Date")
Invalid value for argument `date_of_birth`: Provided Date object is invalid.
```
**Status:** Validation error for DD/MM/YYYY format (Bug #NEW-1)

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement Date Format Detection (Priority: High)
- Auto-detect DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY
- Provide user configuration option for date format preference
- Add format validation with clear error messages

### 2. Add Dancer Deletion Capability (Priority: Medium)
- Add delete button to edit dancer page (if not intentionally restricted)
- Consider soft delete with status='inactive' for audit trail
- Validate no active entries reference dancer before deletion

### 3. Complete Competition Filter (Priority: Low)
- Populate dropdown with actual competitions
- Or hide dropdown if only one competition exists
- Current state suggests incomplete implementation

### 4. Improve Reservation Management for Studio Directors (Priority: Low)
- Consider allowing reservation edits before CD approval (pending status only)
- Add cancellation request workflow (request → CD approves)
- Currently very restrictive, may frustrate users

### 5. Fix Date Timezone Offset (Priority: High)
- Known Bug #1 still present
- Critical for production launch
- All dates consistently off by 1 day

## Testing Methodology

**Tools Used:**
- Playwright MCP for browser automation
- Screenshots for evidence
- Console monitoring for errors
- Database verification via queries

**Testing Approach:**
- Forward progression (Category 1 → 3)
- Real production environment testing
- Studio Director perspective only
- Documented all blockers and limitations

**Quality Assurance:**
- All tests executed with screenshots
- Console errors checked after each test
- Database state verified
- Architectural limitations clearly documented

---

## Conclusion

Agent A successfully tested 20/23 tests across Categories 1-3 with an 85% pass rate. The system handles CSV imports well with minor date format limitations. Manual dancer management works correctly except for missing delete functionality. Reservations are read-only from Studio Director perspective, which appears to be an intentional architectural decision.

**Ready for:** Agent B to begin backward testing from Category 6.

**Next Steps:**
1. Agent B executes Categories 6, 5, 4
2. Merge both reports
3. Address Bug #NEW-1 (date format support)
4. Address Known Bug #1 (date timezone offset)
5. Clarify architectural decisions on SD vs CD capabilities
