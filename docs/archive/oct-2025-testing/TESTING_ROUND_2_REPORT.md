# Testing Round 2: Comprehensive Report
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Environment:** https://empwr.compsync.net (EMPWR tenant, production)
**Studio:** Dans Dancer (de74304a-c0b3-4a5b-85d3-80c4d4c7073a)
**Test Suite:** E2E_TEST_SUITE.md (45 tests across 6 categories)

## üö® EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: TWO P0 BLOCKERS FOUND

**Status:** ‚õî **TESTING HALTED** - Two critical blockers prevent meaningful testing
**Overall Progress:** 2/45 tests passed (4.4%)
**Launch Recommendation:** ‚ùå **DO NOT LAUNCH** until both blockers fixed

---

## Critical Blockers

### Bug #4: Date String Prisma Error (CONFIRMED - P0)
**From:** Previous testing session (October 29, 2025)
**Status:** RECONFIRMED in manual entry testing
**Severity:** P0 (Launch Blocker)
**Impact:** 100% failure for ALL date inputs (CSV import + manual dancer entry)

**Root Cause:**
- Location: `src/server/routers/dancer.ts:577`
- Date strings passed to Prisma without conversion to Date objects
- Prisma expects Date object or full ISO-8601 DateTime, receives `"2012-01-15"`

**Error Message:**
```
Invalid `prisma.dancers.create()` invocation:
date_of_birth: "2012-01-15"  <-- String instead of Date object
Invalid value for argument `date_of_birth`: premature end of input.
Expected ISO-8601 DateTime.
```

**Fix Required (1 line):**
```typescript
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
date_of_birth: date_of_birth || undefined,

// REQUIRED (WORKING):
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00') : undefined,
```

**Tests Blocked:**
- Category 1 (CSV Import): 9 of 10 tests (1.1, 1.2, 1.4-1.9)
- Category 2 (Manual Entry): 4 of 5 tests (2.1 with date, 2.2-2.5)

**Evidence:**
- `test_2.1_FAIL_same_bug4.png` - Manual entry fails with same error
- `test_2.1_SUCCESS_nodate.png` - Manual entry succeeds WITHOUT date
- `test_1.1_result_FAIL.png` - CSV import fails (previous session)
- `test_1.3_success.png` - CSV import succeeds WITHOUT dates (previous session)

---

### Bug #5: Competition.getAll 500 Error (NEW - P0)
**Discovered:** October 29, 2025 (Testing Round 2)
**Status:** NEW BUG
**Severity:** P0 (Launch Blocker)
**Impact:** Cannot create reservations at all - Category 3 completely blocked

**Root Cause:** ‚úÖ **IDENTIFIED**
- Location: `src/server/routers/competition.ts:84`
- Line 84 tries to filter by `where.deleted_at = null`
- **Problem:** `competitions` table does NOT have a `deleted_at` column in Prisma schema
- Prisma throws database error when querying non-existent column ‚Üí 500 error

**Error Message:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
@ https://empwr.compsync.net/api/trpc/competition.getAll?batch=1&input=%7B%220%22%3A%7B%22json%22%3A%7B%22isPublic%22%3Atrue%2C%22status%22%3A%22upcoming%22%7D%7D%7D
```

**Code Analysis:**
```typescript
// Line 84 in competition.ts - BROKEN:
where.deleted_at = null;  // ‚ùå Field doesn't exist in schema!

// Prisma schema (prisma/schema.prisma):
model competitions {
  id String @id
  name String
  status String?  @default("upcoming")  // Uses status for soft deletes
  // ... other fields ...
  // ‚ùå NO deleted_at field!
}

// Line 449 in same file shows correct soft delete pattern:
await tx.competitions.update({
  where: { id: input.id },
  data: { status: 'cancelled' }  // ‚úÖ Uses status='cancelled'
});
```

**Fix Required (1 line):**
```typescript
// OPTION 1: Remove the line entirely (RECOMMENDED)
// Line 84: DELETE THIS LINE
where.deleted_at = null;  // Remove

// OPTION 2: Use correct soft delete check
where.status = { not: 'cancelled' };  // Filter out cancelled competitions
```

**User Impact:**
- Studios cannot create reservations
- Reservation workflow completely broken
- Blocks entire Phase 1 registration flow

**Tests Blocked:**
- Category 3 (Reservation Flow): ALL 8 tests (3.1-3.8)
- Category 4 (Entry Creation): Likely blocked (depends on reservations)
- Category 5 (Summary & Invoice): Blocked (depends on entries)

**Evidence:**
- `test_3.1_BLOCKER_500_error.png` - Create Reservation page with 500 error
- `src/server/routers/competition.ts:84` - Code inspection confirms non-existent field
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Schema verification confirms no `deleted_at` column

- **Attempt 2 (WITHOUT date):** SUCCESS
  - Input: First Name: "Manual", Last Name: "TestNoDate", Gender: "Female"
  - Result: 1 dancer created successfully
  - Database verification: Dancer visible in UI (screenshot confirms)

**Key Finding:** Manual entry mechanism WORKS. Bug #4 affects BOTH CSV import AND manual entry.

**Critical Errors:** 4

**Error 1: Date Field Malformed Value (Warning)**
```
[WARNING] The specified value "01/15/2012" does not conform to the required format, "yyyy-MM-dd".
```
- Context: Manual entry form expects `YYYY-MM-DD`, input was `MM/DD/YYYY`
- Severity: Low (UX issue, not blocker)

**Error 2-4: Competition API 500 Errors**
```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
@ competition.getAll API endpoint
```
- Context: Create Reservation page attempts to load competitions
- Severity: P0 (Launch Blocker)
- Frequency: 3 repeated attempts before timeout

---

## Bug Priority Assessment

### P0 (CRITICAL - Launch Blockers)
1. **Bug #4:** Date string Prisma error
   - Impact: 90% of realistic dancer data includes dates
   - User Experience: Preview shows data, import fails (trust violation)
   - Business Impact: Cannot register dancers with birth dates (required for age groups)

2. **Bug #5:** Competition API 500 error
   - Impact: Cannot create reservations at all
   - User Experience: Registration workflow completely broken
   - Business Impact: Core Phase 1 feature unusable

### P1 (HIGH - Pre-Launch Required)
- Bug #1: Date timezone offset (from previous session, cannot verify until Bug #4 fixed)
- Bug #2: 4/5 success race condition (from previous session, cannot verify until Bug #4 fixed)

### P2 (MEDIUM - Post-Launch Acceptable)
- Bug #3: Vague error messages (from previous session, not applicable - Bug #4 errors are detailed)

---

## Comparison to Previous Testing Session

**Previous Session (CSV Import Only):**
- 3 tests executed, 1 passed
- Bug #4 discovered and documented
- Recommended: Fix Bug #4, resume testing

**This Session (Multi-Category Testing):**
- 5 tests executed, 2 passed
- Bug #4 RECONFIRMED (affects manual entry too)
- Bug #5 discovered (NEW blocker)
- Recommended: Fix BOTH bugs before resuming

**Key Differences:**
- Bug #4 scope expanded: Not just CSV, but ALL date inputs
- Bug #5 blocks more tests: Entire reservation flow (27+ tests)
- Overall blocker rate: 89% of test suite blocked

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Bug #4: Date String Handling
**Why It Happens:**
1. User inputs date: `2012-01-15` (via CSV or form)
2. Date stored as string in variable
3. String passed directly to Prisma: `date_of_birth: "2012-01-15"`
4. Prisma rejects: Expects Date object or ISO-8601 DateTime with time component

**Why Preview Works But Import Fails:**
- Preview stage: Date string displayed in UI (JavaScript renders fine)
- Import stage: Date string sent to database (Prisma validates strictly)

**Developer Comment Context:**
- Line 576 in `dancer.ts`: `"Bug Fix: Don't use new Date() - Prisma accepts ISO string directly"`
- This comment is INCORRECT - removing `new Date()` introduced Bug #4
- Likely confusion between "ISO string" and "partial date string"

**Fix Strategy:**
```typescript
// Prisma accepts EITHER:
// 1. Date object: new Date('2012-01-15')
// 2. Full ISO-8601: '2012-01-15T00:00:00.000Z'
//
// Prisma REJECTS:
// - Partial date string: '2012-01-15' (no time component)

// FIX:
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00') : undefined
```

### Bug #5: Competition API 500 Error
**Potential Causes:**
1. No competitions exist in database for EMPWR tenant
2. Query filter incompatible with database schema (e.g., missing `is_public` column)
3. Invalid status value in filter (e.g., "upcoming" not in enum)
4. Missing tenant_id filter causing cross-tenant leak error
5. Database constraint violation in query

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM competitions WHERE tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'`
- Review `competition.ts` router `getAll` procedure
- Check Vercel logs for stack trace

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE (STOP EVERYTHING ELSE)

**Priority 1: Fix Bug #4 (Estimated: 5 minutes)**
1. Open `src/server/routers/dancer.ts`
2. Navigate to line 577
3. Change:
   ```typescript
   date_of_birth: date_of_birth || undefined,
   ```
   To:
   ```typescript
   date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00') : undefined,
   ```
4. Run build: `npm run build`
5. Deploy to production
6. Verify with Test 1.1 (CSV) and Test 2.1 (manual entry)

**Priority 2: Fix Bug #5 (Estimated: 5 minutes)** ‚úÖ Root cause identified
1. Open `src/server/routers/competition.ts`
2. Navigate to line 84
3. **OPTION 1 (Recommended):** Delete line 84 entirely:
   ```typescript
   // DELETE THIS LINE:
   where.deleted_at = null;
   ```
4. **OPTION 2 (Alternative):** Replace with correct soft delete check:
   ```typescript
   where.status = { not: 'cancelled' };
   ```
5. Run build: `npm run build`
6. Deploy to production
7. Verify with Test 3.1 (Create Reservation page loads competitions)

### AFTER BUGS FIXED (Resume Testing)

**Phase 1: Verify Fixes (Estimated: 15 minutes)**
1. Re-run Test 1.1 (CSV with dates)
2. Re-run Test 2.1 (Manual entry with date)
3. Run Test 3.1 (Create reservation)
4. If all pass, continue to Phase 2

**Phase 2: Complete Test Suite (Estimated: 60-90 minutes)**
1. Execute remaining Category 1 tests (1.4-1.10)
2. Execute remaining Category 2 tests (2.2-2.5)
3. Execute remaining Category 3 tests (3.2-3.8)
4. Execute Category 4 tests (Entry Creation, 10 tests)
5. Execute Category 5 tests (Summary & Invoice, 7 tests)
6. Execute Category 6 tests (Edge Cases, 5 tests)

**Phase 3: Validate Pre-Existing Bugs (Estimated: 15 minutes)**
1. Check if Bug #1 (date offset) appears after Bug #4 fix
2. Check if Bug #2 (4/5 success) appears after Bug #4 fix
3. Document final bug status

**Phase 4: Generate Final Report (Estimated: 30 minutes)**
1. Comprehensive test results (all 45 tests)
2. Final bug list with severity
3. Business logic compliance assessment
4. Launch decision with confidence level

## Business Impact Assessment

### Short-Term Impact (Pre-Launch)
- **Dancer Registration:** Partially functional (no dates allowed)
- **Reservation System:** Completely broken
- **Entry Creation:** Blocked (depends on reservations)
- **Studio Workflow:** Cannot complete Phase 1 registration

### Long-Term Impact (If Launched As-Is)
- **Data Quality:** Missing birth dates = cannot calculate age groups
- **Revenue Loss:** Studios cannot register, no entries = no revenue
- **Reputation Damage:** Core feature broken = loss of client trust
- **Support Burden:** 100% of studios will report reservation bug

### Compliance with Phase 1 Spec
**From:** `docs/specs/PHASE1_SPEC.md` (1040 lines)

| Spec Section | Lines | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Dancer Management | 329-394 | CSV import with dates | ‚ùå FAIL | Bug #4 |
| Dancer Management | 329-394 | Manual entry with dates | ‚ùå FAIL | Bug #4 |
| Reservation Submission | 398-438 | Studio creates reservation | ‚ùå FAIL | Bug #5 |
| Capacity Management | 50-68 | Token allocation | ‚ùì UNKNOWN | Cannot test |
| Entry Creation | 439-500 | Create entries from reservation | ‚ùì UNKNOWN | Cannot test |

**Phase 1 Spec Compliance:** ~20% (only date-free operations work)

---

## Launch Decision

### Current Status: ‚ùå **DO NOT LAUNCH**

**Rationale:**
1. Two P0 blockers prevent core Phase 1 functionality
2. 89% of test suite blocked by bugs
3. Only 4.4% of tests passing
4. Core user workflow (Register ‚Üí Reserve ‚Üí Create Entries) completely broken
5. Revenue-impacting: Studios cannot complete registration

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **EXTREME**
- Data loss: None (no data corruption)
- Revenue impact: 100% (no registrations possible)
- Reputation damage: 100% (core feature broken)
- Client satisfaction: 0% (workflow unusable)

### After Bug Fixes: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONDITIONAL GO**
