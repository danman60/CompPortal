# EMPWR Data Integrity Check-In

Hi,

During a routine data integrity audit, I found a few items in EMPWR that need your input before I can fix them.

---

## Items Requiring Confirmation

### 1. POWERHOUSE DANCE COMPANY - St. Catharines #1

**Invoice Status:** PAID ($38,539.22)

**Issue:** The invoice was paid, but the 144 routines are still showing as "draft" in the system instead of "submitted". This is a data sync issue - the routines were invoiced correctly but their status wasn't updated.

**Question:** Can I update all 144 routines to "submitted" status to match the paid invoice?

---

### 2. Arcade Dance Arts - St. Catharines #2

**Invoice Status:** PAID ($1,644.15)

**Issue:** Similar situation - invoice was paid for 12 routines, but the reservation status shows "approved" instead of "invoiced" and routines are still in "draft".

**Question:** Can I update the 12 routines to "submitted" and mark the reservation as "invoiced"?

---

## Minor Items (Can Fix Automatically)

These are small data alignment issues I can fix without approval:

- **Dancesations (St. Cath #2)** - Reservation status should be "invoiced" (invoice already sent)
- **DANCEFX (St. Cath #2)** - 1 stray draft entry (108 submitted, 1 missed)
- **Poise Dance (St. Cath #1)** - 1 stray draft entry (58 submitted, 1 missed)

---

## FEVER - St. Catharines #2 (FYI)

FEVER has 6 entries in draft status, but their invoice is VOID. This might be intentional (entries added after the invoice was voided). Let me know if you want me to look into this.

---

## Summary

**Needs Approval:**
- POWERHOUSE and Arcade - Confirm before I fix

**Auto-Fix Ready:**
- Dancesations, DANCEFX, Poise - Will fix after your OK

**Monitor:**
- FEVER - Check if intentional

Let me know and I'll get these cleaned up!
