```
Read docs/REFACTORING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority 1.
```

**Verify Fix**:
1. Create 3 entries with different fees ($30, $50, $75)
2. Check summary bar
3. Should show $155.00 (not $150.00)

---

### Fix #2: Check Console Errors

   - Reservations
   - Invoices
   - Settings
4. Look for RED errors (warnings are OK)
5. Fix any critical errors

**Common Errors to Check**:
- 404s for missing files
- CORS errors
- Authentication errors
- Database connection errors

### Fix #3: Build Verification

**Run**:
```bash
cd D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal
npm run build
```

**Expected Output**:
```

‚úì Linting and checking validity of types
‚úì Collecting page data
‚úì Generating static pages (55/55)
‚úì Collecting build traces
‚úì Finalizing page optimization

## üìä Monitoring During Testing Week

### Daily Metrics to Track

**Bug Count by Severity**:
- üî¥ Critical (app broken): 0 target
- üü† High (workflow blocked): < 3 per day
- üü° Medium (workaround exists): < 10 per day
- üü¢ Low (cosmetic): unlimited

**Resolution Time**:
- Critical: < 2 hours
- High: < 1 day
- Medium: < 3 days
- Low: Backlog (post-testing)

**Test Coverage**:

- [ ] Mobile testing completed
- [ ] Edge cases tested (invalid inputs, etc.)
- [ ] Performance tested (100+ entries)

---

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Production Goes Down

**Steps**:
1. Check Vercel status: https://vercel.com/status
2. Check Supabase status: https://status.supabase.com
3. Check recent deployments in Vercel Dashboard
4. If recent deploy caused it: Rollback to previous deployment
5. If external service: Wait for status page updates
6. Communicate downtime in testing channel

**Rollback in Vercel**:
```
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí comp-portal-one
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Find last working deployment
4. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for DNS propagation
6. Test site is back up
```

---

### If Database Gets Corrupted

**Steps**:
1. Don't panic - we have backups
2. Run wipe script again (creates fresh state)
3. Re-run self-test flows
4. Resume testing

**Note**: Testing data is expendable. Better to wipe and start fresh than debug corrupted test data.
