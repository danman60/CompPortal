# Known Issues & Limitations

**Last Updated**: December 13, 2025
**Status**: Phase 2 Scheduling Development
**Next Review**: Before Phase 2 production launch (Dec 18)

## 🚨 Known Bugs (To Be Fixed)

### 1. "Add Studio with Reservation" Duplicate Check Bug
**Location:** `reservation.ts:1932-1936`
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Identified, not yet fixed

**Problem:** Duplicate check only looks at `contact_email` field, not `email` field. Studios with `email` populated but `contact_email = NULL` can create duplicate reservations.

**Impact:** Elite Star Dance Academy affected. Workaround: Manual reservation creation by CD.

**Fix Required:** Update duplicate check to include both `email` and `contact_email` fields.

---

### 2. Router Ordering Inconsistency (Game Day)
**Location:** `liveCompetition.ts:88`
**Severity:** Critical (before Game Day)
**Status:** Identified, not yet fixed

**Problem:** Different Game Day components use different ordering fields:
- Backstage API: `schedule_sequence ASC, entry_number ASC`
- Audio Manifest: `performance_date ASC, schedule_sequence ASC`
- tRPC getLineup: `running_order ASC` (WRONG)

**Impact:** Different views could show different lineup orders.

**Fix Required:** Change `liveCompetition.ts:88` from `running_order` to `schedule_sequence`.

---

### 3. Status Filter Inconsistency (Game Day)
**Location:** `liveCompetition.ts:76`
**Severity:** High (before Game Day)
**Status:** Identified, not yet fixed

**Problem:** tRPC getLineup filters `status: 'registered'` but other APIs filter `status != 'cancelled'`. May exclude valid entries with status 'submitted'.

**Fix Required:** Change to `status: { not: 'cancelled' }`.

## ✅ Recently Fixed Bugs (Dec 2025)

### Invoice Calculation Bugs (Session 78)
**Resolved:** December 6, 2025
**Details:** `INVOICE_CALCULATION_INCIDENT_DEC06_2025.md`

4 bugs fixed:
1. `balance_remaining` not initialized on creation (invoice.ts:893-894)
2. Discount mutations don't update `balance_remaining` (invoice.ts:1249, 1313, 1386)
3. Partial payment uses wrong base (invoice.ts:2469)
4. PDF missing `other_credit_amount` display (pdf-reports.ts:908-916)

## 🔴 Pre-Launch Data Requirements

### dancer_names Array Denormalization
**Required Before:** Phase 2 Scheduling Launch (Dec 18)
**Status:** NOT BACKFILLED on production

**Problem:** `dancer_names[]` on `competition_entries` is only 3-5% populated for production tenants despite `entry_participants` having 99-100% coverage.

**Impact:**
- Conflict detection fails
- Backstage display shows blank dancer info
- Schedule V2 can't show dancer names

**Current State:**
- EMPWR: 5% populated (needs ~1,311 entries backfilled)
- Glow: 3% populated (needs ~1,731 entries backfilled)
- Trigger: ✅ Active for new entries

**Fix:** Run backfill SQL in `PREFLIGHT_SCHEDULING_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## ⚠️ Limitations (Expected Behavior - NOT Bugs)

### 1. **Reservation Capacity Enforcement**
**What testers might report**: "I can't create more routines even though I have space"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Studios can only create routines up to their `spaces_confirmed` limit
- If at limit, "Create Routine" button is disabled with tooltip
- This is intentional to prevent over-booking

**Workaround for Testing**:
- Competition Director can increase capacity via "Reduce Capacity" modal (works both ways)
- Or create a new reservation

---

### 2. **Invoice Visibility by Role**
**What testers might report**: "Studio Director can't see invoice after Competition Director creates it"

**Expected Behavior**:
- DRAFT invoices: Only Competition Directors can see (not sent yet)
- SENT invoices: Studio Directors can now see it
- PAID invoices: Everyone can see it

**Status Flow**: DRAFT → SENT (SD can see) → PAID (locked)

---

### 3. **Email Sending Delays**
**What testers might report**: "Email didn't arrive immediately"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Emails are sent asynchronously (non-blocking)
- May take 1-2 minutes to arrive
- Check spam folder
- Email failures are logged but don't block operations

**Verify**: Check browser console for "Email sent" logs

---

### 4. **Entry Numbers Assignment**
**What testers might report**: "Entry numbers are missing / not sequential"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Entry numbers assigned when reservation is approved (not at creation)
- Numbers may have gaps if entries are cancelled
- Late entries get suffix (e.g., #45A, #45B)

---

### 5. **Tax Calculation**
**What testers might report**: "Invoice has no tax"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Tax is ONLY applied if Competition Director sets `tax_rate` in Competition Settings
- Default is 0% (no tax)
- To test: Set tax_rate to 0.07 (7%) in competition settings

**Location**: Dashboard → Competitions → [Competition] → Settings → Tax Rate

---

### 6. **Incomplete Reservation Submission**
**What testers might report**: "System let me submit with fewer routines than reserved"

**Expected Behavior**:
- User gets WARNING modal showing unused spaces
- Can proceed if they understand spaces will be forfeited
- This is intentional flexibility (studios change plans)

---

### 7. **Music Upload Pending State**
**What testers might report**: "Music shows as pending forever"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Music uploads to Supabase Storage (may take 30-60 seconds for large files)
- If stuck, refresh page
- Check file size < 50MB
- Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A

---

## 🔧 Test Data Recommendations

### For Clean Testing
Run the database wipe script BEFORE testing:
```bash
# See: scripts/README_WIPE_DATABASE.md
# This creates fresh demo data:
# - 3 demo accounts (CD, SD1, SD2)
# - 1 competition (EMPWR Dance Challenge 2025)
# - 1 approved reservation
# - 5 sample dancers
```

### For Realistic Testing
- Create at least 2 studios
- Create at least 2 competitions (different dates)
- Test with 20-30 dancers per studio
- Test with 50-100 routines per competition
- Test late entries (entry_number already assigned)

## 💡 Tips for Effective Testing

### Do's ✅
- Test as both Competition Director AND Studio Director
- Try to "break" the system (invalid inputs, edge cases)
- Test on mobile devices (responsive design)
- Report UI/UX issues even if not "bugs"
- Take screenshots of any weirdness

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't test with production-like email addresses (use test@example.com)
- Don't create real studio/competition data during testing
- Don't skip steps in workflows (test complete flows)
- Don't assume "it's my fault" - report confusing UX
