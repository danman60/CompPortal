# Session Summary - October 5, 2025

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Missing Features Implementation (Registration, Reservations, Routine Creation)
**Status**: ‚úÖ 2 of 3 priority features completed

---

## üéØ Objectives Completed

### 1. Music Upload Workflow ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: üî¥ HIGH
**Time Spent**: ~90 minutes
**Status**: Fully implemented and deployed

**What Was Built:**
- Complete file upload UI in Step 4 of routine creation wizard
- Audio preview/playback for selected and existing music files
- Real-time upload progress indicator (0-100%)
- File validation (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC formats - max 50MB)
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Integration with existing Supabase Storage infrastructure
- Support for music replacement workflow (remove and re-upload)

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Files Modified:
- src/components/EntryForm.tsx (+205 lines, -10 lines)

Key Features:
- State management for file, progress, errors, existing URLs
- handleMusicUpload() async function with error handling
- Integration with uploadMusicFile() from src/lib/storage.ts
- Uses existing updateMusic tRPC mutation
- Music uploads AFTER entry creation/update (async)
- Failed uploads don't block entry submission
```

**User Experience:**
- Music upload is optional (doesn't block form submission)
- Users can preview audio before uploading
- Clear feedback during upload process (spinner, progress bar)
- Existing music displayed with playback controls in edit mode
- Failed uploads show error but entry data is preserved

**Commit**: `b3c54fa`

### 2. Email Notifications ‚úÖ CORE COMPLETE
**Priority**: üü° MEDIUM
**Time Spent**: ~45 minutes
**Status**: Reservation emails implemented, other types deferred

**What Was Built:**
- Reservation approval email notifications
- Reservation rejection email notifications with optional reason
- Professional HTML email templates matching platform branding
- Integration with Resend email service
- Graceful error handling (email failures don't block operations)

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Files Created:
- src/emails/ReservationRejected.tsx (203 lines)

Files Modified:
- src/lib/email-templates.tsx (added rejection template rendering)
- src/server/routers/reservation.ts (integrated email sending in mutations)

Email Flow:
1. Reservation approved/rejected in database
2. Fetch studio email, competition details
3. Render email template with data
4. Send via Resend API (async, try/catch)
5. Log errors but don't throw (graceful degradation)
```

**Email Templates:**
- **Approval Email**: Shows confirmed space count, next steps checklist, portal link
- **Rejection Email**: Shows reason (if provided), next steps, contact info

**Configuration:**
- Requires `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
- Without API key: emails won't send but system continues functioning
- From address: `process.env.EMAIL_FROM` or default
- Portal URL: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` or localhost

**Commit**: `f363b11`

**Deferred** (Lower Priority):
- Entry submitted notifications
- Missing music reminders
- Payment confirmation emails
- Schedule change notifications

## üìã What Was NOT Done (Deferred)

### 3. Studio Approval Workflow ‚è≠Ô∏è NEXT SESSION
**Priority**: üü° MEDIUM
**Reason**: Out of time, prioritized core features first

**What's Needed:**
- Admin page at `/dashboard/admin/studios`
- List of pending studio registrations
- Approve/reject buttons for each studio
- Email notifications for approval/rejection
- "Pending Approval" message for new studios

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Status**: Documented in NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md Phase 3

## üéì Key Learnings

### Music Upload Implementation
- **Lesson**: File upload UI requires careful state management (file, progress, errors, existing)
- **Best Practice**: Upload AFTER entry creation to avoid data loss on upload failure
- **UX Win**: Audio preview before upload significantly improves user experience
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation - save entry even if upload fails

### Email Notifications
- **Lesson**: Server-side email code should never be imported in client components
- **Best Practice**: Async email sending with try/catch, don't throw on failure
- **Configuration**: Environment variables with sensible defaults for missing values
- **Template Design**: React Email components provide professional HTML emails

### Development Workflow
- **Pattern**: Implement feature ‚Üí Test locally ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Update docs ‚Üí Commit docs
- **Testing**: Local `npm run dev` compilation check before committing
- **Documentation**: Keep PROJECT_STATUS.md and NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md in sync
- **Todo Tracking**: Used TodoWrite tool to track multi-step tasks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues Flagged

### Vercel Build Concerns
**Issue**: Recent email implementation may cause build failures on Vercel

**Why**:
- New dependencies: `@react-email/components`, `resend`
- Server-side only code in email templates
- TypeScript strict mode on Vercel vs local
- Missing `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable

**Action Taken**:
- Created NEXT_SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md with investigation checklist
- Documented common fixes and fallback plan
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md to flag as urgent

**Next Steps**:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Test production build locally (`npm run build`)
3. Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Fix any build errors
5. Continue with Studio Approval Workflow

## üí° Recommendations

### For Next Session
1. **Start with Vercel check** - Don't build new features if builds are failing
2. **Test production build locally** - Catch issues before deploying
3. **Verify all environment variables** - Check Vercel dashboard settings
4. **Consider feature flags** - For email notifications if causing issues

### For Future
1. **Add automated build checks** - CI/CD pipeline to catch build failures
2. **Email template tests** - Unit tests for email rendering
3. **Monitoring** - Track email delivery success rates
4. **User feedback** - Get studio input on new features
