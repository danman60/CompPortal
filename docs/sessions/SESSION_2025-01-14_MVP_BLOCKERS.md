# Session Log - MVP Blocker Fixes & CSV Enhancements

**Date**: January 14, 2025 (Late Evening)
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Critical MVP test blocker resolution + CSV import improvements
**Status**: ✅ ALL COMPLETE

---

## Session Overview

This session addressed two critical MVP blockers discovered during production testing, plus implemented CSV import enhancements (Quick Wins #1 & #2 from fuzzy-import analysis).

### Goals
1. ✅ Fix routine summary/invoice generation for Demo Dance Studio
2. ✅ Fix Competition Director routine detail view error
3. ✅ Implement flexible CSV header normalization
4. ✅ Implement smart column suggestions with fuzzy matching

---

## Critical Fixes

### Blocker #1: Routine Summary/Invoice Generation

**Problem**: Demo Dance Studio not appearing in routine summaries page, "Invoice Created" button never showing

**Root Cause**:
- Strict filtering at invoice.ts:300-302 was removing studios that hadn't completed ALL confirmed routines
- Missing invoice status fields in query response

**Solution** (commit fcfb7d9):
```typescript
// BEFORE - Blocked partial submissions
if (reservation && group._count.id < (reservation.spaces_confirmed || 0)) {
  return null;
}

// AFTER - Allow partial invoice generation
// NOTE: Removed strict routine completion check to allow partial invoice generation
// CDs can now generate invoices even if not all routines are complete
```

**Changes**:
- invoice.ts:300-318: Removed strict completion check
- invoice.ts:230, 273-284: Added invoices fetch in parallel
- invoice.ts:294-297: Created invoice map for status lookup
- invoice.ts:336-338: Added hasInvoice, invoiceId, invoiceStatus fields
- invoice.ts:300, 364: Renamed return array to 'summaries' (avoid conflict)

**Impact**:
- Demo Dance Studio now appears in routine summaries
- "Invoice Created" button correctly shows created vs. create states
- CDs can generate invoices for partial submissions

### Blocker #2: CD Routine Detail View Error

**Problem**: Competition Directors getting error page when viewing any routine

**Root Cause**:
- entry.getById included `reservations` relation that wasn't needed
- Component EntryDetails.tsx doesn't use reservation data

**Solution** (commit fcfb7d9):
```typescript
// Removed reservations include from query (entry.ts:292-299)
// EntryDetails component never references entry.reservations
```

**Changes**:
- entry.ts:272-313: Removed reservations include from getById query

**Impact**:
- CDs can now view routine details without errors
- Reduced query complexity (removed unnecessary join)

## CSV Import Enhancements

### Feature: Flexible Header Normalization (Quick Win #1)

**Implementation** (commit 85c032b):

Created `src/lib/csv-utils.ts` with:

**1. normalizeHeader() Function**
```typescript
// Handles various formats:
"First Name" → "first_name"
"firstname" → "first_name"
"FIRST-NAME" → "first_name"
"first.name" → "first_name"

// Transformations:
- Lowercase conversion
- Whitespace trimming
- Replace spaces/dashes/dots with underscores
- Remove special characters
- Collapse multiple underscores
```

**2. Field Variations Mapping**
```typescript
FIELD_VARIATIONS = {
  first_name: ['firstname', 'fname', 'given_name', 'givenname', 'first'],
  last_name: ['lastname', 'lname', 'surname', 'family_name', 'familyname', 'last'],
  date_of_birth: ['dob', 'birthdate', 'birth_date', 'dateofbirth', 'birthday'],
  email: ['email_address', 'e_mail', 'emailaddress', 'mail'],
  phone: ['phone_number', 'phonenumber', 'tel', 'telephone', 'mobile', 'cell'],
  // ... more variations
}
```

### Feature: Smart Column Suggestions (Quick Win #2)

**Implementation** (commit 85c032b):

**1. suggestColumnMatch() Function**
- Uses fast-levenshtein library for fuzzy matching
- Confidence threshold: 70% (configurable)
- Returns: `{ field: string, confidence: number }`

**Matching Priority**:
1. Exact match → confidence: 1.0
2. Known variation → confidence: 0.95
3. Fuzzy match → confidence: 0.7-1.0 (based on string distance)

**2. mapCSVHeaders() Function**
- Maps all CSV headers to canonical field names
- Returns: mapping, unmatched headers, suggestions
- Suggestions include confidence scores for user review

**3. Updated DancerCSVImport Component**
```typescript
// Before - rigid matching
const headers = lines[0].split(',').map(h => h.trim().toLowerCase());

// After - flexible matching
const { mapping, unmatched, suggestions } = mapCSVHeaders(csvHeaders, DANCER_CSV_FIELDS, 0.7);
setHeaderSuggestions(suggestions); // Store for user review
```

**Benefits**:
- Users can upload CSVs with any reasonable header format
- System automatically maps to canonical field names
- Suggestions with <1.0 confidence shown to user for review
- Significantly reduces CSV import errors

## Build Verification

**Local Build**:
```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 12.7s
✓ 54 routes generated
✓ Zero TypeScript errors
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/server/routers/invoice.ts` (invoice status fields + removed filter)
- `src/server/routers/entry.ts` (removed reservations include)
- `src/lib/csv-utils.ts` (NEW - 200 lines)
- `src/components/DancerCSVImport.tsx` (flexible header mapping)

- Removed strict routine completion check (invoice.ts:300-318)
- Added invoice status fields: hasInvoice, invoiceId, invoiceStatus (invoice.ts:336-338)
- Fetched existing invoices in parallel with reservations (invoice.ts:230, 273-284, 294-297)
