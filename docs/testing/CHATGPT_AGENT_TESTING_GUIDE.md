### Key Changes (This Session)

**1. Tenant Settings Authorization (commit 0073976)**
- **Problem**: Super Admin couldn't access tenant settings page (403 Forbidden)
- **Root Cause**: Authorization logic in `tenantSettings.ts` didn't explicitly allow super_admin role
- **Fix**: Updated 7 mutations (lines 151, 186, 221, 252, 287, 322, 358):
  ```typescript
  // BEFORE
  if (ctx.tenantId !== input.tenantId || ctx.userRole === 'studio_director')

  // AFTER
  if (ctx.userRole === 'studio_director' ||
      (ctx.tenantId !== input.tenantId && ctx.userRole !== 'super_admin'))
  ```
- **Impact**: Super Admins can now configure tenant-wide competition settings (age divisions, entry sizes, pricing, classifications, dance categories, scoring systems)
- **Tested**: ✅ All 3 tabs working (Age Divisions, Entry Sizes, Pricing & Fees)

**2. Routine Creation/Edit Flow (Playwright verified)**
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional - no regressions from tenant settings changes
- **Test Results**:
  - Create flow: 3-step wizard working (Basic Info → Add Dancers → Review & Submit)
  - Edit flow: All 5 tabs working (Basic → Details → Participants → Props → Review)
  - Data validation: Required fields enforced correctly
  - Dropdowns: Populated from tenant settings (9 dance categories, 5 classifications)
  - Test routine created: "Playwright Test Routine" (Jazz, Competitive, Teen Solo, $75)

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Entities (38+ tables)

#### Multi-Tenancy
```
tenants (id, slug, subdomain, name, branding, *_settings)
  ├── competitions
  ├── studios
  ├── user_profiles
  ├── reservations
  ├── competition_entries
  ├── invoices
  └── dancers
```

#### User Management
```
auth.users (Supabase Auth)
  └── user_profiles (tenant_id, role, first_name, last_name, phone)
      - Roles: studio_director, competition_director, judge, super_admin
```

#### Competition Workflow
```
competitions (tenant-specific events)
  ├── competition_sessions (day/time blocks)
  ├── competition_locations (venues)
  ├── reservations (studio space bookings)
  │   └── competition_entries (individual routines)
  │       ├── entry_participants (dancers in routine)
  │       ├── scores (judge scores)
  │       ├── awards (placements)
  │       └── documents (music files)
  └── invoices (studio billing)
```

#### Reference Data
```
dancers (studio rosters)
age_groups (Mini, Junior, Teen, Senior, etc.)
classifications (Recreational, Competitive, Elite, Crystal, Titanium)
dance_categories (Ballet, Jazz, Tap, Contemporary, etc.)
entry_size_categories (Solo, Duet/Trio, Small Group, Large Group, Production)
```

#### Judging & Scoring
```
judges (credentials, panel assignments)
  └── scores (technical, artistic, performance, overall)
      └── rankings (category placements)
          └── awards (award types: placement, high score, special)
```

### Key Relationships

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: All data scoped by `tenant_id`
2. **Role-Based Access**: `user_profiles.role` + Row Level Security
3. **Competition → Reservation → Entry**: Studio books spaces, then creates routines
4. **Entry → Participants → Dancers**: Routines reference studio dancers
5. **Entry → Scores → Rankings → Awards**: Judging pipeline

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Production Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **React Hydration Error #419**
   - **Location**: `/dashboard/entries` page
   - **Impact**: Warning in console, page still functional
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Fix**: Investigate client/server HTML mismatch

2. **404 on /api/tenant Endpoint**
   - **Location**: Various dashboard pages
   - **Impact**: Warning in network tab, page still functional
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Fix**: Add tenant API route or remove client-side fetch

3. **Demo Data - Studio ID Truncation**
   - **Location**: Seed data (`prisma/seed.ts`)
   - **Impact**: One demo studio has truncated UUID (35 chars vs 36)
   - **Workaround**: Client-side validation added (EntryForm:208-219)
   - **Priority**: Low (demo data only)
   - **Fix**: Regenerate seed data with correct UUIDs

### Feature Freeze Blockers

- ❌ NO NEW FEATURES until user confirms "MVP 100% working"
- ✅ Bug fixes allowed (explicitly reported by user)
- ✅ Testing and investigation allowed
- ✅ Documentation updates allowed

### Test Coverage Gaps

1. **No automated tests** (npm test returns error)
2. **No unit tests** for tRPC routers
3. **No integration tests** for payment flow
4. **Limited Playwright tests** (manual E2E only)
5. **No performance tests** (load testing, stress testing)

### Recommended Next Steps (Post-MVP)

1. Add automated test suite (Vitest + Playwright)
2. Implement CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
3. Add error monitoring (Sentry)
4. Add analytics (PostHog or Mixpanel)
5. Implement audit logging (all CRUD operations)
6. Add 2FA for super_admin role
7. Implement rate limiting (tRPC middleware)
8. Add GDPR compliance tools (data export, deletion)

## 🤖 Testing Instructions for AI Agents

### Prerequisites

1. **Playwright MCP Integration** (required for browser testing)
   - MCP server: `@playwright/mcp`
   - Available tools: `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_take_screenshot`
   - Production URL: `https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/`

2. **Supabase MCP Integration** (optional for database queries)
   - MCP server: `@supabase/mcp`
   - Available tools: `execute_sql`, `apply_migration`, `get_advisors`
   - Database: PostgreSQL 15+ (Supabase)

3. **Vercel MCP Integration** (optional for deployment checks)
   - MCP server: `@vercel/mcp`
   - Available tools: `get_deployments`, `get_build_logs`, `get_runtime_logs`

### Testing Workflow

#### 1. Start Session
```
Read files (in order):
1. PROJECT_STATUS.md (current state)
2. CURRENT_WORK.md (active work)
3. This file (CHATGPT_AGENT_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
4. git log -10 --oneline (recent commits)

Total context: ~8k tokens
```

#### 2. Select Test Scenario
```
Choose from:
- Super Admin Tests (tenant settings, studio verification)
- Studio Director Tests (routines, dancers, music, invoices)
- Competition Director Tests (reservations, invoices, judging)
- Judge Tests (score entry)
- Critical Journeys (full end-to-end flows)
```

#### 3. Execute Test with Playwright MCP
```
Example: Test routine creation

1. browser_navigate("https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/")
2. browser_click(element="Email input", ref="...")
3. browser_type(element="Email input", text="demo.studio@gmail.com")
4. browser_click(element="Password input", ref="...")
5. browser_type(element="Password input", text="StudioDemo123!")
6. browser_click(element="Sign In button", ref="...")
7. browser_navigate("/dashboard/entries/create")
8. browser_snapshot() (capture page state)
9. browser_click(element="Dance Category dropdown", ref="...")
10. browser_select_option(element="...", values=["Jazz"])
11. ... (continue test steps)
12. browser_take_screenshot(filename="routine-created.png")
```

#### 4. Verify Results
```
- Check page snapshot for expected elements
- Verify database state (optional: use Supabase MCP)
- Capture screenshots as evidence
- Log any errors or unexpected behavior
```

#### 5. Report Findings
```
Format:
### Test: [Test Name]
**URL**: [Page URL]
**Status**: ✅ PASSING | ❌ FAILING | ⏸️ BLOCKED
**Duration**: [Time in seconds]

STEPS:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

EXPECTED: [Expected result]
ACTUAL: [Actual result]
EVIDENCE: [Screenshot filename]

ISSUES:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]

NOTES:
- [Additional observations]
```

#### 6. Update Documentation
```
If test fails:
1. Create BLOCKER.md with details
2. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md (Known Issues section)
3. Update this file (mark test as ❌ FAILING)

If test passes:
1. Update this file (mark test as ✅ PASSING)
2. Add screenshot to evidence folder
3. Update CURRENT_WORK.md (mark test complete)
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always use Playwright MCP** for UI testing (faster than manual testing)
2. **Capture screenshots** at key steps (evidence for user)
3. **Test production URL** (not localhost, unless explicitly asked)
4. **Use real test data** (demo.studio@gmail.com, not fake emails)
5. **Verify database state** (optional: Supabase MCP) to confirm mutations
6. **Report all findings** (even if test passes, note observations)
7. **Update documentation** (mark tests as passing/failing)

### Error Handling

```
If test fails:
1. Capture error message (screenshot + console logs)
2. Check network tab (browser_console_messages)
3. Verify authentication (session cookie)
4. Check database state (Supabase MCP)
5. Create BLOCKER.md if blocking MVP
6. Report to user with evidence
```

### Context Management

```
If context drops below 15%:
1. STOP immediately
2. Complete current test only
3. Commit results with WIP marker
4. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with next test
5. EXIT testing loop
```
