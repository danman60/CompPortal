## Data Quality Improvements

### **Issues Found in Legacy Data**:
1. **Province validation**: "TRUE" instead of proper province code
2. **Inconsistent formatting**: Phone numbers, postal codes
3. **Missing data**: Empty fields in some records
4. **Text encoding**: Potential issues with accented characters

### **Recommended Improvements**:
1. **Strict validation** - Province/state dropdowns with proper codes
2. **Phone formatting** - Consistent (XXX) XXX-XXXX format
3. **Postal code validation** - Format validation for different countries
4. **Required fields** - Enforce mandatory data for exports
5. **UTF-8 encoding** - Proper character handling for names

## Export Performance Considerations

### **Scalability Requirements**:
- **Large competitions**: 400+ entries, 30+ studios
- **Real-time updates**: Live competition changes
- **Multiple formats**: CSV, PDF, JSON, Excel
- **Concurrent access**: Multiple users exporting simultaneously

### **Optimization Strategies**:
```typescript
// Caching strategy for frequently accessed exports
const exportCache = new Map<string, CachedExport>();

// Background job processing for large exports
interface ExportJob {
  id: string;
  type: ExportType;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  progress: number;
  downloadUrl?: string;
  expiresAt: Date;
}

// Streaming for large datasets
async function streamCompetitionExport(
  competitionId: string,
  format: ExportFormat,
  response: Response
): Promise<void> {
  const stream = createExportStream(competitionId, format);
  return pipeline(stream, response);
}
```

## Integration Points

### **Current System Integration**:
- **Studio codes** must match across all exports
- **Entry numbering** needs to be maintained throughout competition
- **Dancer names** must be consistent across multiple entries
- **Category formats** standardized across all competition materials

### **Modern Platform Integration**:
- **API endpoints** for real-time export generation
- **Webhook notifications** when export jobs complete
- **Permission controls** - different export access levels
- **Audit logging** - track who downloaded what when
- **Version control** - track export format changes over time
