# HARDENING EXECUTION PROMPT

Copy and paste the prompt below to execute any priority from HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md

---

## PROMPT TEMPLATE:

Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority [NUMBER].

Follow these rules:
1. Read the full Priority [NUMBER] section from the doc
2. Create all files exactly as specified in the "Solution" section
3. Modify files exactly as shown in "Implementation Steps"
4. Run `npm run build` after each file change to catch errors early
5. Follow the testing checklist for this priority
6. Commit with format: "harden: [brief description] (Priority [NUMBER])"

Do NOT ask for confirmation. Execute the hardening directly.

---

## EXAMPLE USAGE:

To add business logic status guards:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority 1.

To add error boundaries:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority 2.

To add server-side validation:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority 3.

To add transaction boundaries:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority 4.

To add silent failure detection:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority 5.

To add health checks & monitoring:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority 6.

---

## MULTI-PRIORITY EXECUTION:

To execute multiple priorities in sequence:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priorities 1, 2, and 3 in order.

---

## PARTIAL EXECUTION:

To add only status guards without applying them everywhere:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md, implement Priority 1 Phase 1 only (create statusGuards.ts), then apply only to invoice.ts.

---

## VERIFICATION PROMPT:

After implementation, use this to verify:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and run the testing checklist for Priority [NUMBER]. Report any failures.

---

## ROLLBACK PROMPT:

If something breaks:
Rollback the last hardening commit. Then read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and re-implement Priority [NUMBER] more carefully.

---

## COMBINED EXECUTION WITH REFACTORING:

To implement both hardening and refactoring together:
Read docs/HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority [NUMBER], then read docs/REFACTORING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md and implement Priority [NUMBER].

---

## NOTES:

- Hardening priorities are designed to be incremental (can implement one at a time)
- Each priority is independent (no dependencies between them)
- Testing checklists MUST be completed before marking as done
- Build must pass before committing
- Production testing with Playwright MCP recommended for Priorities 1-4
