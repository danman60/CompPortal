# Launch Day Certainty - November 1, 2025

**Session Date:** November 1, 2025
**Context:** Real studio invitation emails need to go out TODAY
**Status:** BLOCKED - Test invitation button failing

---

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE

**Problem:** "SEND TEST INVITATION" button in SA panel (`/dashboard/admin/testing`) returns error:
```
TRPCClientError: Only Super Admin can send invitations
```

**User Concern:** If test button fails, the real mass invitation button will also fail. No confidence to send to 25+ real studios.

---

## Current State

**Super Admin Account:**
- Email: `danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com`
- Password: `123456`
- Role: `super_admin` (verified in database)
- User WAS logged in as SA when test button failed

**Test Studio Setup:**
- Name: "Test Studio - Daniel"
- Email: `daniel@streamstage.live`
- Code: `TEST1`
- Status: `approved` âœ…
- Owner: `NULL` (unclaimed) âœ…
- Tenant: EMPWR âœ…

**Real Studios Status:**
- 25 approved studios
- All have `status: 'approved'` âœ…
- All have `owner_id: NULL` âœ…
- All ready for invitation emails

## Bug Investigation

**Endpoint:** `studioInvitations.sendInvitations` in `src/server/routers/studio-invitations.ts`

**Line 83 check:**
```typescript
if (ctx.userRole !== 'super_admin') {
  throw new TRPCError({
    code: 'FORBIDDEN',
    message: 'Only Super Admin can send invitations',
  });
}
```

**Hypothesis:** `ctx.userRole` is not being set correctly from the session, even though:
1. User IS logged in as danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com
2. Database shows `role: 'super_admin'`
3. User can access `/dashboard/admin/testing` page (which should also require SA)

**Need to investigate:** Where is `ctx.userRole` populated from the user session? There may be a mismatch between database role and context role.

---

## What User Needs

1. **Test button to work** - Send test email to daniel@streamstage.live
2. **Verify email arrives** - Confirm email delivery and claim link work
3. **Test complete flow** - daniel@streamstage.live receives email â†’ clicks claim link â†’ onboarding â†’ dashboard
4. **Confidence to send** - Once test works, send mass invites to all 25 real studios

---

## Next Steps for Next Session

1. **Debug ctx.userRole** - Find where tRPC context is created and why userRole doesn't match database
2. **Check session data** - Verify what's actually in the user's session cookie
3. **Fix the bug** - Ensure SA role from database propagates to ctx.userRole
4. **Test invitation** - Verify test button works
5. **Send real invites** - User can confidently send to 25 studios

---

## Files to Check

- `src/server/trpc.ts` - Context interface (line 13: userRole definition)
- `src/server/routers/studio-invitations.ts` - Invitation endpoint (line 83: role check)
- `src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts` - tRPC API route (likely where context is created)
- Middleware or auth files that populate session data

---

## Console Errors Seen

```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403
TRPCClientError: Only Super Admin can send invitations
```

**403 errors** also appeared when loading `/dashboard/admin/testing` page (multiple requests failed with 403)

---

## User Frustration Points

1. Kept saying "continue" when work was complete (previous session)
2. Got confused about which account was logged in (daniel@ vs danieljohnabrahamson@)
3. Needs EXACT same flow for test as real studios will experience
4. Time-sensitive - emails MUST go out today

---

**Priority:** P0 CRITICAL BLOCKER - Cannot launch without working invitation system
