# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Broken RLS Policies

**SEVERITY**: CRITICAL - Data leakage across studios
**DISCOVERED**: October 8, 2025
**STATUS**: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

---

## üî¥ The Problem

**Multiple RLS policies are BROKEN** - trying to get `studio_id` from `user_profiles` table, but that column doesn't exist!

**Current broken pattern**:
```sql
studio_id IN (
  SELECT dancers.studio_id
  FROM user_profiles
  WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid()
)
```

**This fails silently** and likely returns ALL rows (no filtering) - letting users see data from other studios!

---

## üìä Affected Tables (9 tables)

1. ‚úÖ **dancers** - Users can see ALL dancers from ALL studios
2. ‚úÖ **competition_entries** - Users can see ALL entries from ALL studios
3. ‚úÖ **reservations** - Users can see ALL reservations from ALL studios
4. ‚úÖ **invoices** - Users can see ALL invoices from ALL studios
5. ‚úÖ **email_logs** - Users can see ALL email logs from ALL studios
6. ‚úÖ **documents** - Users can see ALL documents from ALL studios
7. ‚úÖ **entry_participants** - Users can see ALL participants from ALL studios
8. ‚úÖ **awards** - Users can see ALL awards from ALL studios
9. ‚úÖ **rankings** - Users can see ALL rankings from ALL studios

---

## üîß The Fix

**Correct relationship**:
- `auth.users` ‚Üê `studios.owner_id` (user owns studios)
- `studios.id` ‚Üê `dancers.studio_id` (studio has dancers)

**Correct RLS policy**:
```sql
studio_id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM studios
  WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
)
```

##  ‚ö†Ô∏è Why "Add Dancer" Failed

**Error**: "you need to be associated with a studio to add dancers"

**Root Cause**: Your new user account doesn't have a studio yet!

**The flow should be**:
1. User signs up
2. User creates/registers their studio
3. User can now add dancers to their studio

**Current issue**: No onboarding flow to create studio after signup!

---

## üîÑ Immediate Actions

### 1. Fix RLS Policies (URGENT - stops data leakage)
```bash
# Apply the SQL migration above via Supabase dashboard or MCP
```

### 2. Create Studio for Your Test Account
```sql
-- Temporary fix: Create studio for your new user
INSERT INTO public.studios (
  owner_id,
  name,
  status
) VALUES (
  '[YOUR_NEW_USER_ID]',  -- Get from auth.users
  'Test Studio',
  'approved'
);
```

### 3. Build Studio Onboarding Flow
- After signup, redirect to "Create Your Studio" page
- Collect studio info (name, address, etc.)
- Create studio record linked to user
- Then allow dancer management

---

## üß™ Test After Fix

1. **Apply RLS fix**
2. **Create studio for test user**
3. **Login as test user**
4. **Try to view dancers** - should see NONE (or only from their studio)
5. **Try to add dancer** - should work now
6. **Login as original demo user**
7. **Verify they can't see test user's dancers**

---

## üìã Next Steps

1. Apply RLS fix immediately (use Supabase MCP)
2. Get your new user's ID
3. Create studio for that user
4. Test data isolation works
5. Build proper studio onboarding flow

**Status**: Ready to apply fix via MCP
