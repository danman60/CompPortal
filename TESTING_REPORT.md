## üêõ Bugs Fixed This Session

### Bug #1: Success Screen Not Showing After Routine Creation
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED (commit 42d34c3)
- **Symptom**: After creating routine, redirected directly to entries list instead of showing success screen with "Another Like This" button
- **Root Cause**: Missing `setShowSuccess(true)` in createMutation.onSuccess handler (EntryForm.tsx:184)
- **Fix**: Added setShowSuccess(true) to match updateMutation pattern
- **Test Result**: Not yet verified (needs new deployment)
- **File**: src/components/EntryForm.tsx:184

## üö® Critical Bugs Found (Need Fixes)

### Bug #2: Invoice Generation Fails with 400 Error
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **URL**: `/dashboard/invoices/[studioId]/[competitionId]`
- **Error**: 400 Bad Request from `invoice.generateForStudio` TRPC endpoint
- **Symptom**: Shows "Invoice Not Found - Unable to generate invoice for this studio and competition"
- **Context**:
  - Invoice shows as "PENDING" in invoices list
  - Has $230.00 total for 2 routines
  - Cannot view invoice details
- **Console Error**:
  ```
  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400
  https://www.compsync.net/api/trpc/invoice.generateForStudio?batch=1&input=...
  ```
- **Impact**: CD cannot view/manage invoices, blocking payment workflow
- **Related**: May be connected to Bug #3

### Bug #3: Submitted Summaries Not Appearing in Routine Summaries Page
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **URL**: `/dashboard/routine-summaries`
- **Symptom**: Page shows "No routine submissions found" despite successful summary submission
- **Context**:
  - Summary was submitted successfully (received success message)
  - 2 routines created, 23 unused spaces released
  - But CD cannot see the submission to approve it
- **Impact**: Breaks Phase 1 workflow - CD cannot approve summaries or generate invoices
- **Phase 1 Spec Reference**: Lines 398-438 (summary submission), 589-651 (summary approval)
- **Likely Cause**:
  - Summary submission may not be creating `reservation_summaries` record
  - Or query in routine-summaries page is filtering incorrectly
  - Status mismatch between what's created and what's queried

### Bug #4: React Hydration Error on Entries Page
- **Severity**: Medium (page still renders correctly)
- **URL**: `/dashboard/entries`
- **Error**: `Minified React error #419` (Hydration failed)
- **Symptom**: Console error but page renders correctly anyway
- **Impact**: Non-blocking but indicates SSR/CSR mismatch
- **Screenshot**: entries-page-hydration-error.png
- **Note**: Despite error, all functionality works (can see routines, submit summary)

3. ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: CD cannot see summary in routine-summaries page
4. ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: CD cannot approve summary (not visible)
5. ‚ùå **BLOCKED**: Invoice generation fails with 400 error

### Phase 1 Flow Status:
**40% Complete** - Blocked at summary approval step

---

## üîß Required Fixes (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Fix Summary Approval Workflow (Bug #3)
**Impact**: Blocks entire Phase 1 workflow
**Action**: Investigate summary submission - ensure `reservation_summaries` record created with correct status
**Files**:
- Backend: Check summary submission mutation
- Frontend: /dashboard/routine-summaries query

### Priority 2: Fix Invoice Generation (Bug #2)
**Impact**: Cannot test Other Credits feature, cannot complete payments
**Action**: Debug invoice.generateForStudio endpoint - likely missing required data or invalid status check
**Files**: Backend invoice generation logic

### Priority 3: Fix React Hydration Error (Bug #4)
**Impact**: Low - page works but console errors are unprofessional
**Action**: Find SSR/CSR mismatch in entries page

### Priority 4: Verify "Another Like This" Fix
**Impact**: Medium - UX improvement for routine creation
**Action**: Test after next deployment (commit 42d34c3)

## üìù Notes

### Login Credentials Used:
- **CD**: 1-click button (works perfectly)
- **SD**: danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com / 123456 (manual login required)
- **SD Demo Button**: Broken (returns ?error=demo_login_failed)

### User Feedback Reference:
User has mentioned CD 1-click auth multiple times - this is now documented and working.

### Phase 1 Spec Compliance:
Current implementation partially matches Phase 1 spec but breaks at summary approval step. Need to verify:
- Lines 398-438: Summary submission logic
- Lines 589-651: Summary approval and capacity refund
- Lines 669-680: Invoice generation requirements

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Fix Bug #3** (summary approval) - CRITICAL blocker
2. **Fix Bug #2** (invoice generation) - CRITICAL blocker
3. **Re-test full Phase 1 flow** end-to-end
4. **Verify "Another Like This" button** works with new deployment
5. **Test CSV import functionality**
6. **Test Other Credits field** (once invoices work)
7. **Fix SD demo login button** (low priority)
