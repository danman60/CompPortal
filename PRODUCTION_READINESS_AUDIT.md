# CompPortal Production Readiness Audit

**Date**: October 20, 2025 12:44 PM EST
**Auditor**: Claude (Automated Assessment)
**Scope**: Production deployment for ~60 Studio Directors
**Timeline**: Pre-production launch with multi-client support requirement

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Readiness**: 🟡 **MODERATE RISK - REQUIRES ACTION BEFORE PRODUCTION**

CompPortal has a solid foundation with good security practices (RLS, RBAC, GDPR compliance), but has **5 CRITICAL GAPS** that must be addressed before serving 60 real clients, especially when handling PII of minors.

### Critical Blockers (MUST FIX)
1. 🔴 **Multi-Tenant Architecture Missing** - Currently hardcoded to single tenant (EMPWR)
2. 🔴 **No Production Error Tracking** - Silent failures not captured
3. 🔴 **No Backup/Disaster Recovery Plan** - No documented recovery process
4. 🔴 **WebSocket Authentication Bypass** - Insecure `dev-token` in production
5. 🔴 **Security Vulnerability** - xlsx package has 2 high-severity CVEs

### High Priority (FIX BEFORE SCALE)
- No application-level rate limiting (Supabase/Vercel defaults only)
- No external monitoring/alerting (UptimeRobot, PagerDuty, etc.)
- No PII encryption at rest documentation
- No data retention policy for minors' data

### Good Foundations ✅
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- GDPR compliance (data export, deletion)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Health check endpoint
- Structured logging
- 2FA and IP whitelisting available

---

## 1. Security Assessment 🔒

### 1.1 PII Protection (Minors' Data) ⚠️ MODERATE RISK

**Data Stored:**
- `dancers.date_of_birth` - DOB of minors (potentially thousands)
- `dancers.medical_conditions`, `allergies`, `medications` - Health data
- `dancers.parent_email`, `parent_phone` - Guardian contact info
- `dancers.emergency_contact_name`, `emergency_contact_phone` - Emergency contacts

**Current Protection:**
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled - studios can only access their own dancers
✅ Role-based access control - CDs and super_admins have oversight
✅ GDPR compliance - data export and deletion implemented
✅ Supabase encryption in transit (TLS)
✅ Supabase encryption at rest (AES-256) [Assumed - Supabase default]

**GAPS:**
🔴 **No documented encryption at rest verification** - Assumed Supabase default, not confirmed
🔴 **No field-level encryption** - Sensitive fields like medical_conditions stored in plaintext
🔴 **No data retention policy** - How long to keep minors' data after competition ends?
🔴 **No data minimization audit** - Do we need medical_conditions, allergies, medications?
⚠️ **No parent consent workflow** - No documented parental consent for data collection

**Recommendations:**
1. **Verify Supabase encryption at rest** (1 hour)
   - Check Supabase dashboard settings
   - Document encryption status in security policy

2. **Implement data retention policy** (2 hours)
   - Define retention period (e.g., 90 days post-competition)
   - Create scheduled job to anonymize/delete expired data
   - Document in privacy policy

3. **Add parent consent workflow** (8 hours)
   - Checkbox during dancer registration
   - Store consent timestamp and IP address
   - Required for COPPA compliance (US) or local regulations

4. **Consider field-level encryption for medical data** (16 hours)
   - Encrypt `medical_conditions`, `allergies`, `medications` columns
   - Use crypto library (e.g., @47ng/cloak) with key rotation
   - Only for high-compliance scenarios

---

### 1.2 Authentication & Authorization ✅ GOOD

**Status:** Strong foundation with some gaps

✅ Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
✅ Role-based access control (3 roles: studio_director, competition_director, super_admin)
✅ RLS policies enforce data isolation
✅ Password requirements enforced
✅ 2FA available (optional)
✅ IP whitelisting available (optional)

**GAPS:**
🔴 **WebSocket auth uses `dev-token`** (CRITICAL_ISSUES.md:66-149)
   - Risk: Anyone can connect and view real-time scoreboard
   - Fix: 4-8 hours to implement Supabase JWT verification
   - **MUST FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION**

⚠️ **2FA not mandatory** - Optional for all users
   - Recommendation: Enforce 2FA for competition_director and super_admin roles
   - Implementation: 2-4 hours

⚠️ **No session timeout policy documented**
   - Recommendation: Document session lifetime (default: 1 hour with Supabase)
   - Verify refresh token rotation enabled

---

### 1.3 Security Vulnerabilities 🔴 CRITICAL

**1. xlsx Package CVE (CRITICAL_ISSUES.md:10-63)**

**Severity:** HIGH
**CVE:** GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6 (Prototype Pollution), GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9 (ReDoS)
**Attack Vector:** Malicious CSV/Excel file upload
**Impact:** Server-side prototype pollution or denial of service
**Affected Code:** `src/components/RoutineCSVImport.tsx` (only usage)

**Mitigation Options:**
1. **Replace with exceljs** (4 hours, RECOMMENDED)
   ```bash
   npm uninstall xlsx
   npm install exceljs
   ```
   - No known vulnerabilities
   - Similar API, straightforward migration

2. **Add strict input validation** (1 hour, PARTIAL)
   - File size limit (max 5MB)
   - File type validation
   - Sandboxed parsing
   - Does NOT fix underlying CVE

3. **Remove CSV import** (30 minutes, NOT RECOMMENDED)
   - Feature heavily used by studios
   - Blocks bulk dancer registration

**Recommendation:** Replace with exceljs before production launch

---

### 1.4 API Security ✅ GOOD

✅ tRPC with Zod validation on all mutations
✅ SQL injection prevented (Prisma parameterized queries)
✅ XSS protection (React auto-escaping)
✅ CSRF protection (tRPC built-in)
✅ Environment variables not exposed to client

**GAPS:**
⚠️ **No application-level rate limiting** - Relies on Vercel/Supabase defaults
   - Vercel Edge Network has DDoS protection
   - Supabase has connection pooling limits
   - But no custom rate limits per user/IP for specific endpoints

**Recommendation:** Add rate limiting middleware (4 hours)
```typescript
// Example: Limit 100 requests per minute per user
import { rateLimit } from '@/lib/rate-limit';

export const protectedProcedure = t.procedure
  .use(({ ctx, next }) => {
    return rateLimit(ctx.userId, 100, 60000).then(() => next({ ctx }));
  });
```

---

## 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKER

### Current State
**Status:** ⚠️ **HARDCODED TO SINGLE TENANT (EMPWR)**

From PROJECT_STATUS.md lines 118-127:
> Multi-Tenant Architecture Removal 🔧
> - **Rollback Executed**: Reset to commit b3ab89d (pre-multi-tenant)
> - **Reason for Rollback**: Multi-tenant complexity breaking critical workflows before demo

**Current Implementation:**
- All operations hardcoded to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` (EMPWR tenant)
- Tenant context removed from tRPC context
- No tenant selection mechanism
- All 60 Studio Directors will share the same tenant

### Problem
User stated:
> "prior to production, we basically need to clone the entire app for another client as in another CD login to serve their own discrete SDs with both clients everything able to be seen and managed by the super user"

**This means:**
- Client 1 (EMPWR): 30 Studio Directors
- Client 2 (New CD): 30 Studio Directors
- Super Admin: Can see/manage both

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Requirements

**Option 1: Re-implement Multi-Tenant (RECOMMENDED)**

**Effort:** 40-60 hours (1-1.5 weeks)

**Implementation:**
1. **Restore tenant context in tRPC** (8 hours)
   - Restore `ctx.tenantId` to all routers
   - Extract tenant from user profile
   - Add tenant validation to all queries

2. **Add tenant selection for Super Admin** (8 hours)
   - UI: Tenant switcher dropdown in header
   - Backend: Update tRPC context based on selection
   - Store selected tenant in session

3. **Create tenant onboarding flow** (8 hours)
   - Super Admin creates new tenant
   - Assign Competition Director to tenant
   - Generate tenant subdomain or URL path (optional)

4. **Update all queries with tenant filter** (16 hours)
   - Review all 30 tRPC routers
   - Add `WHERE tenant_id = ctx.tenantId` to all queries
   - Test isolation between tenants

5. **Create tenant settings** (8 hours)
   - Competition categories per tenant
   - Age divisions per tenant
   - Pricing per tenant
   - Branding (logo, colors) per tenant

6. **Testing** (8 hours)
   - Create 2 test tenants
   - Verify data isolation
   - Test Super Admin switching
   - Test CD/SD permissions

**Risks:**
- Was previously rolled back due to complexity
- Requires careful migration of existing data
- Potential for data leakage if not implemented correctly

**Option 2: Clone Deployment (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

**Effort:** 16 hours (2 days)

**Implementation:**
- Deploy separate Vercel project for Client 2
- Create separate Supabase database for Client 2
- Duplicate all code and configuration
- Separate Super Admin dashboard to manage both

**Problems:**
- Code duplication (maintenance nightmare)
- Super Admin needs 2 separate logins
- No unified billing or reporting
- Feature updates require double deployment
- Not scalable beyond 2-3 clients

### Recommendation

**Re-implement multi-tenant architecture** before production launch.

**Phased Approach:**
1. **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Restore tenant context, test with EMPWR (existing data)
2. **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Create Client 2 tenant, test isolation, migrate 30 SDs
3. **Phase 3 (Week 3):** Super Admin tenant switcher, final testing

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Comprehensive testing between tenants
- Data isolation verification (RLS policies already exist)
- Rollback plan if issues arise
- Feature flag to disable multi-tenant if needed

---

## 3. Monitoring & Error Tracking 🔴 CRITICAL

### Current State

**Logging:** ✅ GOOD
- Structured logging implemented (`src/lib/logger.ts`)
- Request ID tracing
- Middleware logging for slow requests (>1s)
- Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)

**Error Tracking:** 🔴 **MISSING**
- No Sentry, Datadog, or similar service configured
- No error aggregation or alerting
- Errors only visible in Vercel logs (hard to search)
- No frontend error boundary reporting

**Monitoring:** ⚠️ **MINIMAL**
- Health check endpoint exists
- Status page exists (`/status`)
- No external uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- No performance monitoring (APM)
- No alerting on critical failures

### Gaps

🔴 **Silent production failures** - No way to know if:
- Users hitting errors (frontend or backend)
- Database queries failing
- Email sending failing (partial - failure_log table exists)
- WebSocket connections dropping
- File uploads failing

🔴 **No alerting** - No way to be notified of:
- Server downtime
- High error rates
- Slow response times
- Database connection pool exhaustion

### Recommendations

**1. Add Error Tracking (CRITICAL - 4 hours)**

Use Sentry (free tier: 5k errors/month):

```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

**Configuration:**
```typescript
// sentry.client.config.ts
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1, // 10% of transactions
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Filter sensitive data
    if (event.request?.cookies) delete event.request.cookies;
    return event;
  },
});
```

**2. Add External Uptime Monitoring (HIGH PRIORITY - 1 hour)**

Options:
- **UptimeRobot** (free, recommended in docs/UPTIME_MONITORING.md)
  - Monitor `/api/health` every 5 minutes
  - Alert on 429 (rate limit) or 503 (down)
  - Slack/email notifications

- **Better Uptime** ($10/month, more features)
  - 30-second checks
  - Status page
  - Incident management

**3. Add Performance Monitoring (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 2 hours)**

Use Vercel Analytics (already in package.json):
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**4. Configure Alerting (HIGH PRIORITY - 2 hours)**

Set up alerts for:
- Health check failures (>2 failures in 5 minutes)
- Error rate spikes (>10 errors/minute)
- Slow response times (p95 > 3s)
- Database connection errors

**Total Effort:** 9 hours (1-2 days)

---

## 4. Scalability for 60+ Users ⚠️ MODERATE RISK

### Current Architecture

**Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router) deployed on Vercel
**Backend:** tRPC API routes (serverless functions)
**Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with PgBouncer pooling
**Connection Pooling:** `connection_limit=1` per serverless function

### Capacity Analysis

**Expected Load (60 Studio Directors):**
- Peak: Competition registration opens
  - Assumption: 30 SDs log in within first 10 minutes
  - Each creates 5-10 entries (reservations + dancers)
  - 30 SDs × 10 requests/min = 300 requests/min

**Steady State:**
- 10-15 concurrent users browsing
- 5-10 requests per user per minute
- 50-150 requests/min baseline

### Database Connection Pooling ✅ CONFIGURED

**Current Setup:**
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"
```

**Analysis:**
- Supabase PgBouncer pooling: ✅ Enabled
- Connection limit per function: ✅ 1 (recommended for serverless)
- Vercel serverless functions: Auto-scale up to 100 concurrent (Hobby) or 1000 (Pro)

**Verdict:** ✅ Should handle 60 users without issue

**Recommendation:** Monitor connection pool usage in Supabase dashboard during first week

---

### Caching ⚠️ NOT CONFIGURED

**Current State:**
- Redis configuration in .env.example: `REDIS_ENABLED=false`
- No CDN configured: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_ENABLED=false`

**Impact:**
- Every request hits database (no caching)
- Repeated queries for same data (e.g., competitions list)
- Higher database load and latency

**Recommendation:**

**Option 1: Enable Redis Caching (RECOMMENDED for >100 users)**
- Effort: 8 hours
- Cost: $5-10/month (Upstash free tier: 10k requests/day)
- Benefit: 50-80% reduction in database queries

**Option 2: Use Next.js Server-Side Caching (QUICK WIN)**
- Effort: 2 hours
- Cost: $0
- Benefit: 30-50% reduction in repeated queries

```typescript
// Example: Cache competitions list for 5 minutes
export const revalidate = 300; // 5 minutes

export default async function CompetitionsPage() {
  const competitions = await prisma.competitions.findMany();
  return <CompetitionsList data={competitions} />;
}
```

**For 60 users:** Next.js caching should be sufficient
**For 100+ users:** Add Redis

---

### Rate Limiting ⚠️ MINIMAL

**Current State:**
- Chatwoot rate limits documented (PRODUCTION_RATE_LIMITS.md)
- No application-level rate limits for main app
- Relying on Vercel/Supabase defaults

**Vercel Defaults:**
- Edge Network: DDoS protection
- Serverless Functions: 100 concurrent (Hobby), 1000 concurrent (Pro)
- No per-user or per-IP limits

**Supabase Defaults:**
- Database connection pooling
- API rate limits (not documented)

**Risk:**
- Single malicious user could exhaust resources
- No protection against brute-force login attempts
- No protection against bulk data scraping

**Recommendation:** Add application-level rate limiting (4-8 hours)

```typescript
// src/lib/rate-limit.ts
import { Ratelimit } from '@upstash/ratelimit';
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(100, '1 m'), // 100 requests per minute
  analytics: true,
});

export async function checkRateLimit(userId: string) {
  const { success, limit, reset, remaining } = await ratelimit.limit(userId);
  if (!success) throw new TRPCError({ code: 'TOO_MANY_REQUESTS' });
}
```

**For 60 users:** Vercel defaults should be sufficient
**For production peace of mind:** Add rate limiting

---

## 5. Data Backup & Disaster Recovery 🔴 CRITICAL

### Current State ⚠️ **NO DOCUMENTED STRATEGY**

**Backups:**
- Supabase: Automatic daily backups (assumed, not verified)
- Retention: Unknown
- Tested: No documented backup tests
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Unknown
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Unknown

**Disaster Recovery:**
- No documented runbook
- No tested recovery procedure
- No failover plan
- No data export scripts for emergency recovery

### Gaps

🔴 **Supabase backup status unknown**
- Free tier: 7-day backups (1 day point-in-time recovery)
- Pro tier: 30-day backups (7 days PITR)
- Need to verify which tier and backup status

🔴 **No backup testing**
- Never tested restore procedure
- No verification of backup integrity
- No test restoration to staging environment

🔴 **No disaster recovery runbook**
- What to do if database is corrupted?
- How to restore from backup?
- Who to contact at Supabase?
- What's the SLA?

🔴 **No data export for critical scenarios**
- What if Supabase is down during competition weekend?
- No local backup of competition schedules, dancers, entries

### Recommendations

**1. Verify Supabase Backup Configuration (IMMEDIATE - 1 hour)**

Action items:
- [ ] Log into Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → Database → Backups
- [ ] Verify backup schedule and retention
- [ ] Document backup tier (free vs. pro)
- [ ] Enable point-in-time recovery if not enabled
- [ ] Document in `docs/BACKUP_POLICY.md`

**Expected Configuration:**
- Daily automatic backups: ✅ Enabled
- Retention: 7 days (free) or 30 days (pro)
- Point-in-time recovery: Last 24 hours (free) or 7 days (pro)

**2. Test Backup Restoration (CRITICAL - 4 hours)**

Create test plan:
1. Create test Supabase project
2. Restore latest backup
3. Verify data integrity
4. Document restoration steps
5. Time the restoration (establish RTO)
6. Schedule quarterly backup tests

**3. Create Disaster Recovery Runbook (HIGH PRIORITY - 8 hours)**

Document:
```markdown
# Disaster Recovery Runbook

## Scenario 1: Database Corruption
- Contact: support@supabase.com
- Steps:
  1. Assess damage scope
  2. Determine last good backup
  3. Create new Supabase project
  4. Restore backup to new project
  5. Update DATABASE_URL in Vercel
  6. Test application
  7. Update DNS if needed
- RTO: 30-60 minutes
- RPO: Last backup (24 hours max)

## Scenario 2: Vercel Deployment Failure
- Steps: [...]

## Scenario 3: Supabase Service Outage
- Steps: [...]
```

**4. Implement Pre-Competition Data Export (HIGH PRIORITY - 4 hours)**

Create admin tool:
- Export all critical data to JSON/CSV before competition weekend
- Store locally on CD's laptop
- Includes: competitions, reservations, dancers, entries, schedules
- Can be imported to new database if disaster occurs

```typescript
// Example admin endpoint
export async function exportCompetitionData(competitionId: string) {
  const data = await prisma.$transaction([
    prisma.competitions.findUnique({ where: { id: competitionId } }),
    prisma.reservations.findMany({ where: { competition_id: competitionId } }),
    prisma.dancers.findMany({ /* joined with reservations */ }),
    prisma.competition_entries.findMany({ where: { competition_id: competitionId } }),
  ]);

  return {
    export_date: new Date().toISOString(),
    competition: data[0],
    reservations: data[1],
    dancers: data[2],
    entries: data[3],
  };
}
```

**5. Set Up Automated Off-Site Backups (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 8 hours)**

Options:
- **Daily export to S3/R2** (recommended)
  - Cron job exports database to JSON
  - Uploads to Cloudflare R2 (free 10GB)
  - Retention: 30 days
  - Cost: ~$0/month

- **Database replication to secondary provider** (expensive)
  - Real-time replication to Neon/PlanetScale
  - Requires pro tier
  - Cost: $20-50/month

**Total Effort:** 25 hours (3-4 days)

---

## 6. Documentation & Runbooks ⚠️ MODERATE

Excellent documentation in `docs/`:
- GDPR_COMPLIANCE.md (684 lines)
- TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION.md (detailed setup)
- IP_WHITELIST.md (security features)
- HARDENING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md (6 priorities)
- QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md
- Multiple testing reports

### Missing Documentation ⚠️

**Operations:**
- No deployment checklist
- No environment setup guide (production)
- No secrets management guide
- No backup/restore procedures (see Section 5)

**Incident Response:**
- No incident response plan
- No escalation matrix
- No on-call rotation (if applicable)
- No postmortem template

**Compliance:**
- No privacy policy document
- No terms of service

**Recommendations:**

Create `docs/operations/`:
1. `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-launch checklist (2 hours)
2. `INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` - What to do when things break (4 hours)
3. `BACKUP_RESTORE.md` - Step-by-step backup procedures (2 hours)
4. `SECRETS_MANAGEMENT.md` - How to rotate keys safely (1 hour)

Create `docs/legal/`:
1. `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` - Required for minors' data (8 hours + legal review)
2. `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md` - User agreements (8 hours + legal review)
3. `DATA_RETENTION.md` - How long we keep data (2 hours)

**Total Effort:** 27 hours (3-4 days) + legal review

---

## 7. Critical Considerations for Real Clients

### 7.1 Financial Impact of Downtime

**Competition Weekend Scenario:**
- 500 dancers registered
- 100 routines per day
- Competition Director on-site, 3 judges
- 60 Studio Directors monitoring remotely

**Downtime Costs:**
- Lost competition time: $500-1000/hour
- Reputation damage: Priceless
- Studio Directors lose confidence: Churn risk

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-competition data export (Section 5.4)
- Offline-first judging (mentioned in SYSTEM_HARDENING.md)
- Disaster recovery runbook (Section 5.3)
- External monitoring with <5 min alert (Section 3.2)

---

### 7.2 Data Loss Scenarios

**Worst Case:** Database corruption during competition weekend

**Impact:**
- All reservations lost
- All entries lost
- All dancer registrations lost
- Competition cannot proceed

**Current Risk:** 🔴 HIGH (no tested backup restoration)

**Mitigation:**
1. Test backup restoration NOW (Section 5.2)
2. Pre-competition data export (Section 5.4)
3. Automated off-site backups (Section 5.5)
4. Point-in-time recovery enabled (Section 5.1)

---

### 7.3 Compliance Risks (Minors' Data)

**Regulations:**
- **COPPA (US):** Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
  - Applies to children under 13
  - Requires parental consent
  - Requires data minimization
  - Penalties: $43,280 per violation

- **GDPR (EU):** If any EU dancers compete
  - Requires parental consent for minors under 16
  - Right to be forgotten
  - Data breach notification (72 hours)
  - Penalties: Up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue

- **State Laws (US):** California, Virginia, Colorado
  - CPRA (California): Requires opt-out for sale of minors' data
  - VCDPA (Virginia): Requires consent for processing sensitive data

**Current Compliance:**
✅ GDPR data export/deletion implemented
✅ RLS protects data access
⚠️ No parental consent workflow
⚠️ No data retention policy
⚠️ No privacy policy
🔴 No legal review of data collection practices

**Recommendation:**
1. **Consult with attorney** (CRITICAL - before launch)
   - Review data collection practices
   - Draft privacy policy and terms of service
   - Determine if COPPA applies
   - Establish data retention policy

2. **Add parental consent checkbox** (8 hours)
   - During dancer registration
   - Store consent timestamp
   - Link to privacy policy

3. **Implement data retention** (16 hours)
   - 90 days post-competition default
   - Scheduled job to delete/anonymize
   - Audit trail of deletions

**Total Effort:** 24 hours + legal review ($2,000-5,000)

---

### 7.4 Support & Escalation

**Current State:** No documented support process

**Questions:**
- Who answers user questions?
- What's the SLA for critical issues?
- How do users report bugs?
- Who's on-call during competition weekends?

**Recommendations:**

1. **Create support tiers:**
   - P1 (Critical): System down - Response: 15 minutes
   - P2 (High): Feature broken - Response: 2 hours
   - P3 (Medium): Minor bug - Response: 24 hours
   - P4 (Low): Enhancement request - Response: 1 week

2. **Support channels:**
   - Chatwoot widget (already integrated)
   - Email: support@compsync.net
   - Emergency hotline: [Phone number] (competition weekends only)

3. **On-call rotation:**
   - Primary: [Developer name]
   - Secondary: [Backup person]
   - Escalation: [CTO/Technical lead]

4. **Documentation:**
   - User guide / help center
   - FAQ for common issues
   - Video tutorials for Studio Directors

## 9. Estimated Timeline & Budget

### Critical Path (Must Do)

| Phase | Tasks | Hours | Weeks | Cost (Legal) |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Phase 1: Security** | WebSocket auth, xlsx fix, backups, monitoring | 22 | 1 | $2-5k legal |
| **Phase 2: Multi-Tenant** | Full architecture implementation | 56 | 1.5 | - |
| **Phase 3: Hardening** | Rate limiting, compliance, DR | 48 | 1 | - |
| **Phase 4: Docs** | Legal, support, training | 50 | 1 | $2-5k legal |
| **Total** | | **176 hours** | **4.5 weeks** | **$4-10k** |

### Development Cost Estimate

Assuming $100/hour contractor rate:
- Development: 176 hours × $100 = **$17,600**
- Legal review: **$4,000-10,000**
- **Total: $21,600-27,600**

### Minimum Viable Production (MVP)

If budget/time constrained:
- **Phase 1 only:** 22 hours, 1 week, $2,200 dev + $2-5k legal = **$4,200-7,200**
- Defers multi-tenant (deploy separate instance for Client 2)
- Defers hardening (accept higher risk)

**Risk:** Higher incident likelihood, no multi-tenant support

## 12. Conclusion

CompPortal has a **solid technical foundation** with good security practices (RLS, RBAC, GDPR compliance) and a well-architected codebase. However, **5 critical gaps** must be addressed before serving 60 real clients with minors' PII.

### Go / No-Go Decision

**🔴 NO-GO for production** without:
1. Multi-tenant architecture (for 2nd client)
2. WebSocket authentication fix
3. Backup testing and DR runbook
4. Error tracking and monitoring
5. Legal review of minors' data handling

**🟢 GO for production** after Phase 1 (1 week, 22 hours) IF:
- Only serving 1 client (EMPWR)
- Accepting higher operational risk
- Legal consultation completed

**✅ PRODUCTION-READY** after Phases 1-3 (3.5 weeks, 126 hours):
- Multi-tenant support for 2 clients
- Production-grade monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery tested
- Compliance requirements met
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Next Steps

1. **Review this audit** with technical and legal stakeholders
2. **Prioritize fixes** based on budget and timeline
3. **Assign ownership** for each critical task
4. **Schedule legal consultation** ASAP
5. **Create project plan** for Phases 1-4
6. **Set launch date** after critical fixes complete
