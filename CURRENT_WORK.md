# CURRENT WORK STATUS
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025 15:30 EST
**Session:** Session 8 - Email & Capacity Crisis RESOLVED

## ‚úÖ SESSION 8 FIXES COMPLETE (4 Critical Bugs - Awaiting Verification)

**Duration:** 10:30am-3:30pm EST (5 hours)
**Commits:** 5 (86f21a4, 967028c, 4ff7d7b, 476a512, 68e421e)
**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes deployed to production (commit 68e421e)
**Build:** ‚úÖ Passing (verified by user)

### Critical Issues Fixed:

**22. Email Notifications Completely Blocked** (commit 86f21a4)
- **Symptom:** NO email_logs, NO activity_logs, but approvals working
- **Evidence:** User tested 5+ times, mutation executing successfully per network tab
- **Root Cause:** Uncaught error in capacity update (lines 691-698) killing execution before email code
- **Solution:** Wrapped capacity update in try/catch block
- **Files:** reservation.ts:689-707
- **Testing:** NOT TESTED - awaiting user verification

**23. Catastrophic Capacity Double-Deduction** (commit 967028c)
- **Symptom:** 75-space reservation deducted 150 spaces (298‚Üí448)
- **Evidence:** St. Cath #1: 130 actual spaces vs 448 deducted = 318 extra (2.45x over)
- **Root Cause:** createManual creates with status='approved', re-approval deducts AGAIN
- **Solution:** Only decrement if existingReservation.status === 'pending'
- **Files:** reservation.ts:690-710
- **Testing:** NOT TESTED - awaiting user verification

**24. Entry Creation Schema Mismatch** (commit 68e421e)
- **Symptom:** "column routine_number does not exist in the current database"
- **User Clarification:** "routine number is for a later function to do with scheduling but not during routine creation"
- **My Initial Wrong Fix:** Removed from schema (commit 476a512) - would break scheduling
- **Correct Solution:** Added routine_number column to database + restored to schema
- **Files:** prisma/schema.prisma:448, migration file
- **Testing:** NOT TESTED - awaiting user verification

**25. Schedule Builder Field Mapping** (commit 4ff7d7b)
- **Symptom:** Trying to update competition_entries.routine_number in schedule lock
- **Root Cause:** competition_entries uses entry_number, not routine_number for entry identification
- **Solution:** Changed scheduleBuilder.ts:279 from routine_number to entry_number
- **Files:** scheduleBuilder.ts:279
- **Impact:** Schedule locking will work when feature is used

### Database State
- ‚úÖ Wiped completely clean
- ‚úÖ All competition capacities reset to 600/600
- ‚úÖ 4 competitions exist, 2 user profiles
- ‚úÖ 0 studios, 0 reservations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Seed function broken (manual testing required)

### User Feedback
**Frustration Points:**
- "honestly i'm very frsutrated at all the regression and tiny bugs, i wonder if its from all the rewriting and if we should start from scratch"
- "We've literally already done a DB schema sync cleanup, but I guess we have to do it again"
- "WHO THE FUCK WAS TALKING ABOUT SCHEDULE LOCKING" (I was looking at wrong code section)

**Critical Clarification:**
- User confirmed: "routine number is for a later function to do with scheduling but not during routine creation"
- This prevented me from breaking the scheduling feature permanently

**Deployment Confirmation:**
- User always waits for fresh deploy before testing
- User confirmed deployment 68e421e is live
- User tested in incognito browser on correct page (reservation-pipeline)

## üöß IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION REQUIRED (BLOCKING)

### User Must Test Before Demo (3 Days Away):

**1. Email Delivery Verification (15 minutes)**
- Create SD account and studio
- Create reservation for 75 spaces
- Approve as CD
- Verify email arrives at SD's email
- Check database:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM email_logs ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 1;
  SELECT * FROM activity_logs WHERE action = 'reservation.approve' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
  ```
- Expected: Both tables have new entries

**2. Capacity Math Verification (5 minutes)**
- Before approval:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, available_reservation_tokens FROM competitions WHERE name = 'St. Cath #1';
  ```
  Expected: 600
- Approve 75-space reservation
- After approval: Should be 525 (exactly 75 deducted)
- NOT 450 (would indicate double-deduction still happening)

**3. Entry Creation Verification (5 minutes)**
- Create new entry/routine as SD
- Should succeed without "routine_number does not exist" error
- Database has routine_number column now

**4. Routine Space Refunding (20 minutes) - NEVER TESTED**
- Approve reservation for 100 spaces (600 ‚Üí 500)
- Create 75 routines as SD
- Submit routine summary
- Verify capacity refunded: 500 ‚Üí 525 (25 refunded)
- Verify reservation.is_closed = true
- User report: "I submitted a Summary for London with 12/100 spaces, spaces were not refunded"
