- Check WebSocket authentication (no dev-token)
- Approve Phase 3 if Phases 1-2 successful

### For User Review
- PRODUCTION_READINESS_AUDIT.md (full context)
- PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (detailed work order)
- This file (current progress)

### Questions for User
1. Approve Phase 3 execution? (resilience docs)
2. Schedule legal consultation? (Phase 4)
3. Plan Phase 5 supervision? (multi-tenant)
4. Budget approval for full implementation?
