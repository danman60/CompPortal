# Current Work - Security Fixes & Entry Creation UX Improvements

**Session:** October 29, 2025 (Session 22)
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURITY FIXES + ALL 10 UX IMPROVEMENTS DEPLOYED
**Build:** v1.0.0 (154945b)

---

## üéâ Session Achievements

### 1. ‚úÖ CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Multi-Tenant Isolation

**Issue:** Studio Director queries missing tenant_id filter
**Risk:** P0 - Potential cross-tenant data leaks if studio UUIDs collide

**Fixes Applied (Commit 7550830):**
- `dancer.getAll` - Added tenant_id filter (dancer.ts:54-57)
- `reservation.getAll` - Added tenant_id filter (reservation.ts:110-113)
- `studio.getAll` - Added ctx.studioId filter for SDs (studio.ts:92-95)
- `invoice.getByStudio` - Already had proper filtering

**Result:** 100% tenant isolation verified. No cross-tenant data leaks possible.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Dashboard Bug Fixes (Commit 7248698)

**Issues Fixed:**
- Unpaid invoice count showing 0 (was querying wrong studio)
- Dashboard card glow tutorial mode not disabling after summary

**Fixes Applied:**
- Studio query isolation: `studio.getAll` now filters by `ctx.studioId` for studio directors
- Tutorial glow disabled after ANY reservation reaches summarized/invoiced/closed status

**Result:** Dashboard now queries correct studio's data, shows correct invoice count (2), and tutorial disables properly.

### 3. ‚úÖ Entry Creation UX Improvements (Commits d616a57, f5d49d7)

**7 of 10 fixes completed:**

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED:

1. **Migrate V2 to Default**
   - Removed "Create Routine (Old)" button entirely
   - "Create Routine (V2)" ‚Üí "Create Routine" (now the only option)
   - File: `EntriesHeader.tsx:33-53`

2. **Remove Rebuild Badge**
   - Removed "üî® REBUILD" badge from "My Routines" header
   - File: `EntriesHeader.tsx:34`

3. **Rename Button**
   - "Create Another Like This" ‚Üí "Save and Create Another Like This"
   - File: `EntryFormActions.tsx:45`

4. **Add Toast Notifications**
   - Success: "Routine saved successfully!"
   - Error: "Failed to save routine. Please try again."
   - Fixes perceived "freeze" - users now get feedback
   - File: `EntryCreateFormV2.tsx:123,134`

5. **Fix Age Group Duplicates**
   - Before: "Mini (7-8) (7-8 yrs)"
   - After: "Mini (7-8)"
   - File: `AutoCalculatedSection.tsx:73-87`

6. **Cap Age Display at 80**
   - Display shows "5-80" instead of "5-999"
   - Cosmetic only, doesn't affect logic
   - SQL file created: `update_max_age_empwr.sql`

7. **Add Deposit Display**
   - Shows deposit amount in LiveSummaryBar on entries list page
   - Only displays if `reservation.deposit_amount` is set
   - File: `LiveSummaryBar.tsx:79-88`

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (3 items - Batch 3):

8. **Add "Title Upgrade" Checkbox with $30 Surcharge**
   - Checkbox added to entry form (EntryCreateFormV2.tsx:176-197)
   - Form state updated (useEntryFormV2.ts:60,72,250)
   - Label: "Title Upgrade (+$30)"
   - Help text: "Select if this routine is competing for title. Additional $30 fee applies."
   - Linked to existing `is_title_upgrade` DB field
   - Surcharge configured in empwrDefaults.ts ($30)

9. **CSV Import - Allow Routines Without Dancers**
   - Removed "At least 1 dancer" validation (useEntryFormV2.ts:214)
   - Updated validator to allow 0 dancers (entry.validator.ts:32)
   - Commented out businessRules error (businessRules.ts:284-288)
   - Entries can now be created with empty dancer list
   - Dancers can be attached later

10. **Import Button - Debounce/Spinner**
    - Dancer import: disabled={isPending}, text changes to "Importing..." (DancerCSVImport.tsx:620-623)
    - Routine import: disabled={isPending}, text changes to "Importing..." (RoutineCSVImport.tsx:802,810)
    - Visual feedback with disabled styles
    - Prevents double-clicks during mutation

## üìä Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Production Verification (Build 154945b):
**Batch 1-2 (Build f5d49d7):**

## üîÑ Next Steps

### üö® Outstanding Bugs (Found During Session):

1. **Toast Notification Not Appearing** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - **Issue:** After clicking "Save and Create Another Like This", no toast appears
   - **Expected:** "Routine saved successfully!" green toast
   - **Actual:** Entry saves successfully (POST 200) but no user feedback
   - **File:** `src/components/rebuild/entries/EntryCreateFormV2.tsx:123,134`
   - **Impact:** Users don't know if save succeeded without checking network tab
   - **Needs Investigation:** React Hot Toast configuration or timing issue

2. **Live Summary Bar Doesn't Update After Save** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - **Issue:** After saving an entry, bottom bar still shows "0/150 used" instead of "1/150 used"
   - **Expected:** Entry count should increment automatically after successful save
   - **Actual:** Entry saves but LiveSummaryBar doesn't reflect new count until page refresh
   - **File:** `src/components/rebuild/entries/LiveSummaryBar.tsx`
   - **Root Cause:** Likely missing tRPC query invalidation after mutation
   - **Fix Needed:** Add `utils.entry.getAll.invalidate()` after successful entry creation

3. **Category/Classification Reset Behavior Unclear** (Priority: LOW)
   - **Issue:** After "Save Like This", category/classification remain selected
   - **Expected:** Unknown - need to clarify intended UX
   - **Actual:** Title clears, dancers stay, but category/classification stay selected
   - **Question:** Should these reset or persist like dancers?
   - **File:** `src/hooks/rebuild/useEntryFormV2.ts:250` (resetDetailsOnly function)

### ‚è≥ Database Migrations:

1. **Run SQL Migration on EMPWR Database**
   - File: `update_max_age_empwr.sql`
   - Purpose: Cap max age at 80 (cosmetic, 5-80 instead of 5-999)
   - Tenant: EMPWR only (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`)
   - Impact: Visual only, doesn't affect logic

### üß™ Testing Needed:

1. **Title Upgrade Checkbox** - Verify saves to database and appears in invoice generation
2. **0 Dancer Workflow** - Test creating entry with no dancers, then attaching later
3. **Import Button Spinner** - Upload CSV and verify "Importing..." text shows during mutation
