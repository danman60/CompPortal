# Current Work - Entry Creation tenant_id Resolution

**Session:** October 28, 2025 (Late Session)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Systematic tenant_id audit complete
**Last Commit:** f09df3e (all tenant_id fixes)
**Build Status:** ✅ PASS (63/63 pages)
**Tokens Used:** ~120k/200k

---

## ✅ RESOLUTION COMPLETE

**Root Cause:** Multiple `prisma.create()` operations missing `tenant_id` for tables with NOT NULL constraints

**Impact:** Entry creation + other operations failing with 500 errors

**Fix:** Systematic audit and fix of ALL create operations across 8 files

---

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Test User Missing tenant_id ✅
- **Problem:** User profile had `tenant_id: null`
- **Fix:** Updated via SQL: `UPDATE user_profiles SET tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001' WHERE id = 'b3aebafa-e291-452a-8197-f7012338687c'`
- **Result:** User now properly associated with EMPWR tenant

### Issue 2: competition_entries Missing tenant_id ✅
- **Problem:** `entry.ts:969` used relation connect instead of scalar field
- **Fix:** Changed `tenants: { connect: { id: ctx.tenantId } }` → `tenant_id: ctx.tenantId`
- **Commit:** 07b0978

### Issue 3: entry_participants Missing tenant_id ✅
- **Problem:** Nested create in `entry.ts:1056` missing tenant_id
- **Fix:** Added `tenant_id: ctx.tenantId` to nested participant create
- **Impact:** Would have caused 500 error after fixing competition_entries

### Issue 4-10: Systematic Missing tenant_id ✅
Found via complete audit of all `.create()` operations:

| File | Table | Fix Method |
|------|-------|------------|
| email.ts:109 | email_logs | Lookup from studio/competition |
| emailPreferences.ts:44,83 | email_preferences | From ctx.tenantId |
| judges.ts:36 | judges | Lookup from competition |
| scoring.ts:246 | scores | From entry.tenant_id |
| liveCompetition.ts:227 | scores | From entry.tenant_id |
| admin.ts:153 | user_profiles | From ctx.tenantId |

### Issue 5: Prisma Schema Out of Sync ✅
- **Problem:** `email_logs`, `judges`, `scores`, `email_preferences` models missing tenant_id in schema
- **Fix:** Added tenant_id fields + tenants relations to schema.prisma
- **Action:** Regenerated Prisma Client

## 📊 Complete Audit Results

**Tables with NOT NULL tenant_id (verified):**
- ✅ competition_entries
- ✅ entry_participants
- ✅ email_logs
- ✅ email_preferences
- ✅ judges
- ✅ scores

**Tables with NULLABLE tenant_id:**
- user_profiles (now populated for studio directors)

**All fixed in commit:** `f09df3e`

3. `src/server/routers/emailPreferences.ts` - 2 fixes (createMany + upsert)
4. `src/server/routers/judges.ts` - judges create with competition lookup
5. `src/server/routers/scoring.ts` - scores create with entry lookup
6. `src/server/routers/liveCompetition.ts` - scores upsert
7. `src/server/routers/admin.ts` - user_profiles bulk import
8. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added tenant_id to 4 models + relations

## 🟡 Known Data Quality Issues (Non-Blocking)

**Duplicate Categories in EMPWR Tenant:**

**Size Categories:**
- "Duet/Trio" (2-3, $70/participant)
- "Duo/Trio" (2-3, $85 base)
- "Large Group" (10-14, $55/participant) ← In use
- "Large Group" (10-24, $110 base) ← Not used

**Age Groups:**
- Multiple overlapping ranges (Mini/Petite, Junior variants, Teen variants, Senior+/Adult)

**Impact:** Confusing UX in dropdowns
**Priority:** Low (post-launch cleanup)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required):
1. ⏳ Wait for Vercel deployment (~2 min)
2. 🧪 Test entry creation at `empwr.compsync.net/dashboard/entries/create-v2`
3. ✅ Verify 500 error resolved

### Post-Launch (Optional):
1. Clean up duplicate categories in EMPWR tenant
2. Add Prisma middleware to validate tenant_id on all creates
3. Create linter rule to prevent missing tenant_id

## 📝 Lessons Learned

**What Went Wrong:**
- Oct 27 multi-tenant migration didn't audit ALL create operations
- Reactive fixing (whack-a-mole) instead of systematic audit
- No automated validation of tenant_id requirements

**What Went Right:**
- Systematic audit found ALL issues at once
- Prisma schema sync caught additional issues
- Database queries verified actual NOT NULL constraints

**Process Improvement:**
- After ANY schema change affecting multiple tables, run systematic audit
- Use SQL to verify constraints match code expectations
- Consider Prisma middleware for runtime validation

**Session Outcome:** ✅ All NOT NULL tenant_id violations fixed. Entry creation should work after deployment.

**Ready for:** Production testing on empwr.compsync.net
