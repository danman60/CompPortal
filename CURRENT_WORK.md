- Prepares for worst-case scenarios
- High impact for business continuity

---

### Phase 4: Compliance & Legal Prep 📋
**Duration:** 24 hours | **Risk:** 🟢 LOW | **Status:** ⏸️ NEEDS USER INPUT

**Tasks:**

- [ ] 4.2: Parental Consent Workflow (8 hours)

**Why Fourth:**
- Requires user approval on retention policy
- Legal review needed
- Can implement, needs review before production

---

### Phase 5: Multi-Tenant Architecture 🏢
**Duration:** 56 hours | **Risk:** 🔴 HIGH | **Status:** ⏸️ REQUIRES SUPERVISION

**Why Last:**
- Previously rolled back (PROJECT_STATUS.md:118)
- Most complex change (all routers)
- Need all safety nets in place first
- User supervision required
