# Current Work Status

**Date**: October 16, 2025 (Pre-Testing Sprint - Priority 1 Complete)
**Status**: ✅ CRITICAL HARDCODED PRICING BUG FIXED
**Progress**: Refactoring Priority 1 complete, testing prep docs created
**Next**: Complete Phase 1 of pre-testing action plan (Tasks 1.2-1.5)

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (October 16, 2025 - Pre-Testing Sprint)

### Priority 1 Refactoring: Fixed Hardcoded Pricing (commit 8ad272e)

**Issue**: CRITICAL - Violates "NO SAMPLE DATA" policy
- EntriesList.tsx had hardcoded `$50 × count` in 2 locations
- Users saw incorrect pricing estimates instead of actual fees
- Blocked accurate testing before major testing week

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### 1. Fixed Summary Bar Pricing (EntriesList.tsx:879)
- **Before**: `${(filteredEntries.length * 50).toFixed(2)}`
- **After**: `${filteredEntries.reduce((sum, e) => sum + Number(e.total_fee || 0), 0).toFixed(2)}`
- **Impact**: Summary bar now shows accurate total from database

#### 2. Fixed Summary Modal Pricing (EntriesList.tsx:1145)
- **Before**: `${(filteredEntries.length * 50).toFixed(2)}`
- **After**: `${filteredEntries.reduce((sum, e) => sum + Number(e.total_fee || 0), 0).toFixed(2)}`
- **Impact**: Summary modal now shows accurate total from database

#### 3. Added total_fee to Query (entry.ts:213)
- **Issue**: tRPC query didn't include `total_fee` field
- **Fix**: Added `total_fee: true` to getAll select statement
- **Impact**: Frontend now has access to actual fee data

**Testing Docs Created**:
- `docs/REFACTORING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - 5 priority refactorings with code examples
- `docs/REFACTORING_PROMPT.txt` - Quick execution prompts
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - Testing guide + bug report template
- `docs/TESTING_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step testing setup
- `PRE_TESTING_ACTION_PLAN.md` - 2-3 hour pre-testing checklist

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/EntriesList.tsx` (lines 879, 1145)
- `src/server/routers/entry.ts` (line 213)

**Build Status**: ✅ Passing (55 routes compiled successfully)

## ✅ COMPLETED (October 16, 2025 - Very Late Night Session)

### Invoice Pricing Implementation (commits a5c250e, 0be3b85, 0965203, 7c0d24a)

**Issue Reported**: User created invoice with 72 routines but $0 total

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Entries were created with hardcoded `entry_fee: 0` and `total_fee: 0`
- Location: `UnifiedRoutineForm.tsx:153-154`
- Competition Settings pricing was configured but never applied

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### 1. Auto-Calculate Entry Fees (commit a5c250e)
- **Formula**: `base_fee + (per_participant_fee × dancer_count)`
- **Frontend Calculation**: `UnifiedRoutineForm.tsx:142-160`
  - Fetches pricing from `entry_size_categories` table
  - Calculates on form submission
  - Shows pricing preview in Step 3 review (lines 555-587)
- **Backend Fallback**: `entry.ts:534-556`
  - Server-side calculation if frontend sends $0
  - Queries `entry_size_categories` for pricing
  - Applies same formula
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/UnifiedRoutineForm.tsx`
  - `src/server/routers/entry.ts`

#### 2. Editable Invoice Pricing (commit 0be3b85)
- **New Mutation**: `updateLineItems` in `invoice.ts:664-726`
  - Accepts array of line items with updated prices
  - Recalculates subtotal and total
  - Only allows edits for DRAFT/SENT status (not PAID)
  - Logs activity for audit trail
- **Frontend UI**: `InvoiceDetail.tsx`
  - "Edit Prices" button (visible for DRAFT/SENT invoices only)
  - Inline number inputs for `entryFee` and `lateFee` columns
  - Live recalculation of totals while editing
  - Save/Cancel buttons
  - Uses stored `line_items` from database if invoice exists
- **Permissions**: Both Competition Directors and Studio Directors can edit
- **Workflow**:
  1. CD creates invoice (DRAFT) → can edit prices
  2. CD sends invoice (SENT) → SD sees it → SD can edit prices
  3. CD marks as paid (PAID) → prices locked forever
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/server/routers/invoice.ts`
  - `src/components/InvoiceDetail.tsx`

#### 3. Database Wipe Script (commit 0965203)
- **SQL Script**: `scripts/wipe-database-keep-demos.sql`
  - Deletes ALL data (clean slate for testing)
  - Preserves: Database schema, 3 demo accounts
  - Creates sample data:
    - 1 competition ("EMPWR Dance Challenge 2025")
    - 1 reservation (10 routines allocated, approved)
    - 5 sample dancers (Emily, Sophia, Olivia, Ava, Isabella)
    - Demo studio (owned by Studio Director)
- **README**: `scripts/README_WIPE_DATABASE.md`
  - 4 execution methods documented:
    1. Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (easiest)
    2. Supabase CLI with --file flag
    3. Direct psql connection
    4. Supabase MCP (if configured)
  - Safety warnings and verification steps
  - Troubleshooting guide
- **Files Created**:
  - `scripts/wipe-database-keep-demos.sql`
  - `scripts/README_WIPE_DATABASE.md`

#### 4. Documentation Updates (commit 7c0d24a)
- Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md`:
  - Added "Invoice Pricing Fixes" section
  - Updated Recent Commits list
  - Updated Next Priorities (clean test run)
  - Confidence Level raised to 99%
  - Phase: "Invoice Pricing + Database Testing Tools"

## Earlier Session Work (October 16, 2025)

### Signup/Onboarding Fixes (commits 1a2f3cd, 09b63fc, aaf8a94)

**Issues Reported**:
1. Signup with existing email doesn't show "user already exists" message
2. Onboarding fails with foreign key constraint error
3. User asked twice for details (pre and post email confirmation)
4. Dancer deletion shows generic error instead of helpful message

**Fixes Applied**:

#### 1. Signup Flow Simplification (commit 1a2f3cd)
- **Changed**: 3-step form → single step (email/password only)
- **Moved**: ALL profile collection to post-confirmation onboarding
- **Fixed**: Missing `tenant_id` in studio creation (onboarding/page.tsx:115)
- **Improved**: Error detection regex includes "duplicate" keyword
- **Changed**: `emailRedirectTo` from `/dashboard` to `/onboarding`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/signup/page.tsx` - Removed 10 form fields
  - `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Added tenant_id

#### 2. Dancer Error Messages (commit 09b63fc)
- **Issue**: User saw "500 Internal Server Error" + generic toast
- **Actual Server Message**: "Cannot delete dancer with 1 competition entries. Archive instead."
- **Root Cause**: UI not displaying server error message
- **Fix**: Changed `toast.error('Failed to delete dancer')` to `toast.error(err.message || 'Failed...')`
- **Improved**: Bulk delete shows success/fail counts with specific errors
- **NOT A BUG**: Business logic correctly prevents data integrity issues
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/DancersList.tsx:42` (single delete)
  - `src/components/DancersList.tsx:123-153` (bulk delete)

---

## Build & Deploy Status

**Build**: ✅ Passing (55 routes)
**Production**: https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/
**Last Deployed**: 7c0d24a (docs: Update PROJECT_STATUS with invoice pricing fixes)
**Confidence Level**: 99%

---

## Next Session Tasks

### 1. Run Database Wipe (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Use one of the 4 methods in scripts/README_WIPE_DATABASE.md
# Recommended: Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (copy/paste)
```

### 2. Test Complete Workflow (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Sign up new studio → verify onboarding works
- Create 5 dancers → verify correct studio assignment
- Request reservation → CD approves with 10 routines
- Create routines → **verify fees calculate correctly** (no $0!)
- CD creates invoice → **verify prices show correctly**
- CD edits prices → Send to SD
- SD views invoice → SD edits prices → CD marks as paid
- Verify pricing locked after PAID status

### 3. Verify Production (REQUIRED)
- Competition Settings pricing applied to new entries ✓
- Invoice editing workflow (DRAFT → SENT → PAID) ✓
- Role-based permissions (SD can't see DRAFT) ✓
- Activity logging for invoice actions ✓
- No more $0 invoices ✓

### 4. Configure Supabase MCP (Optional)
User needs to add to MCP config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server", "--project-ref", "dnrlcrgchqruyuqedtwi"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
