# Current Work - Entry Creation V2 Rebuild

**Session:** October 28, 2025
**Context:** ~130k/200k tokens (65%)
**Last Commit:** 440692f
**Build Status:** ✅ PASS (63/63 pages)

---

## Session Summary

**Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed entry creation auth bug (dc394c1)
- ✅ Complete analysis of entry creation issues (ENTRY_CREATE_REBUILD_ANALYSIS.md)
- ✅ Clean rebuild of entry form V2 (440692f)
  - New useEntryFormV2 hook with proper auto-classification
  - 4 updated sub-components (sections)
  - EntryCreateFormV2 main container
  - Deleted legacy contaminated code
- ✅ Updated bug documentation with resolution

**Key Fixes:**
1. Auth: Entry creation now uses `protectedProcedure` + `ctx.tenantId`
2. Auto-classification: Per Phase 1 spec (youngest dancer age, exact count)
3. Tenant isolation: All lookups filter by tenant_id
4. Type safety: All components use correct V2 types

**Files Changed:**
- Created: useEntryFormV2.ts, EntryCreateFormV2.tsx, create-v2/page.tsx
- Updated: 4 section components (RoutineDetails, DancerSelection, AutoCalculated, FormActions)
- Deleted: Old EntryCreateForm.tsx, useEntryForm.ts (had React error #418)
- Docs: ENTRY_CREATE_REBUILD_ANALYSIS.md (comprehensive), ENTRY_CREATION_BUG.md (resolution)

## Testing Required (NEXT SESSION)

**Critical Pre-Launch Testing:**

### EMPWR Tenant (empwr.compsync.net)
- [ ] Login: danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com / 123456
- [ ] Navigate to /dashboard/entries/create
- [ ] **Verify NO duplicate dropdowns:**
  - [ ] Classifications (Titanium, Crystal, etc.)
  - [ ] Age Groups (Tiny, Mini, Teen, etc.)
  - [ ] Size Categories (Solo, Duet/Trio, etc.)
  - [ ] Dance Categories (Ballet, Jazz, etc.)
- [ ] **Test auto-classification:**
  - [ ] Select 3+ dancers with different ages
  - [ ] Verify age group from YOUNGEST dancer
  - [ ] Verify size category from TOTAL count
  - [ ] Test manual override works
- [ ] **Test all 4 save actions:**
  - [ ] Cancel → Returns to entries list
  - [ ] Save → Creates entry, returns to list
  - [ ] Save & Create Another → Creates entry, clears all fields
  - [ ] Create Like This → Creates entry, keeps dancers/category, clears title
- [ ] **Verify entry created successfully (no 500 error)**

### Glow Tenant (glow.compsync.net)
- [ ] Login: glowdance@gmail.com / [password]
- [ ] Repeat all tests above
- [ ] **Verify tenant isolation:**
  - [ ] Cannot see EMPWR data in dropdowns
  - [ ] Entry created with Glow tenant_id
  - [ ] Cannot access EMPWR entries

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Create entry with NO dancers (should block)
- [ ] Create entry with title < 3 chars (should block)
- [ ] Create entry when at capacity (should block)
- [ ] Override age group manually
- [ ] Override size category manually

## Known Issues / Follow-Up

**Database Cleanup (Low Priority):**
- Duplicate rows in classifications table (Titanium x2, Crystal x2)
- Duplicate rows in entry_size_categories (Large Group with different definitions)
- Can clean up after confirming rebuild works

**Architecture Notes:**
- Backend was already correct (dc394c1)
- Frontend just needed to use proper auth context
- Clean rebuild approach worked better than incremental fixes

---

## Resume Instructions

If autocompact occurs:
1. Load this file + ENTRY_CREATION_BUG.md + ENTRY_CREATE_REBUILD_ANALYSIS.md
2. Check: `git log -3 --oneline`
3. Run production tests (Testing Required section above)
4. Verify on BOTH tenants (EMPWR + Glow)

## Previous Work Context

- 10/25 UX recommendations completed (40%)
- Button component and skeleton loaders pending
- Will resume after entry creation verified working
