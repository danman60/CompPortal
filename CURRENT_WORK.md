# CURRENT WORK STATUS
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025 00:10 UTC
**Session:** EMPWR Testing Round 2 Bug Fixes

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES (Session Total: 11 Critical Issues)

### Critical Issues Fixed:
1. **"Deny Reservation" button** - Added onClick handler + reject mutation with modal UI
2. **Token refund logic** - Verified already working in reject/cancel mutations
3. **Event capacity card** - Now uses live reservation_tokens instead of static values
4. **Studio CSV upload 406 error** - Increased body size limit from 2MB to 10MB
5. **Routine CSV import JSZip error** - Added better error handling for corrupted Excel files
6. **Prevent Studio Directors from editing invoices** - Added role checks for edit/discount buttons
7. **Mark as Paid protection** - Already correctly restricted to Competition Directors

### Database & Financial:
8. **Deposit fields added** - deposit_paid_at, deposit_confirmed_by, is_closed fields via migration
9. **Hardcoded 13% HST tax** - Removed dynamic tax rate, now always 13% HST
10. **Manual Payment Only banner** - Added clear indication of offline payment handling
11. **CSV Export functionality** - Added export buttons for both Dancers and Routines

## ðŸš§ REMAINING HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### Complex Logic Required:
1. **Auto-close reservations** - Needs trigger to handle fewer routines than reserved
   - Requires: Backend logic to detect routine count < spaces_confirmed
   - Action: Set is_closed=true, refund unused tokens
   - Database field ready: is_closed added

2. **Invoice lock after send** - Prevent modifications after invoice sent
   - Database field ready: is_locked added
   - Needs: Enforcement in update mutations

3. **Invoice should only include confirmed routines** - Filter by status
   - Current: Includes all non-cancelled entries
   - Needs: Modify invoice generation to filter for confirmed only

4. **Hide individual routine pricing** - Only show total in summary
   - Status: Need to locate where prices are displayed
   - May have been removed already
