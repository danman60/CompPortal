# Current Work Status

**Date**: January 13, 2025 (Evening - Post-MVP User Feedback)
**Status**: üîß BUG FIX MODE - Addressing User Feedback
**Progress**: 12 bug fixes queued from user testing
**Next**: Fix critical blockers preventing routine creation/editing

---

## üö® ACTIVE TODO LIST (January 13 Evening)

User reported issues after testing production:

1. **[IN PROGRESS]** Remove duration_seconds and live_status from all queries/schemas
   - Status: Schema fields commented out, liveCompetition router updated
   - Blocker: Prevents routine creation/editing

2. **[PENDING]** Fix approve/deny on competitions page - add animation and feedback
   - Add toast notification + animation when SD clicks approve/deny
   - Pending reservation should disappear/fade with animation

3. **[PENDING]** Add live summary bar to entries page (Remaining/Created/Price/Submit)
   - Display: Remaining Routines, Created Routines, Price Estimate, Submit Summary button
   - Position: Along bottom of entries page

4. **[PENDING]** Add CSV import for routines with reservation selection
   - Fields: routine_title, dance_category, choreographer, props
   - User selects which approved reservation to assign routines to

5. **[PENDING]** Fix table alignment in entries page (verify with Playwright)
   - Table data shifted left within columns
   - Use Playwright MCP to verify alignment

6. **[PENDING]** Remove hover popup, add click popup for routine details
   - Replace HoverPreview with click-based modal/popup

7. **[PENDING]** Make entire routine card clickable to edit
   - Click anywhere on card ‚Üí open edit page
   - Keep Edit button as well

8. **[PENDING]** Fix create routine - lock to reservation, remove size/age fields, add auto-detect
   - Lock competition dropdown to approved reservation's event
   - Remove classification, size, age fields (auto-detect from dancers)
   - Validation: routine.competition_id must match reservation.competition_id

9. **[PENDING]** Fix edit routine - data not loading, remove live review bar
   - Current data not pre-filled when opening edit page
   - Remove RoutineReviewBar from edit page
   - Error: duration_seconds column doesn't exist

10. **[PENDING]** Create CD Routine Summaries page for invoice creation with discounts
    - New page: /dashboard/routine-summaries
    - CDs can review routine submissions per studio/competition
    - Add discounts before generating invoice
    - Replaces auto-invoice on approval workflow

11. **[PENDING]** Optimize invoices page performance (similar to entries fix)
    - Apply same N+1 query optimization as entries page

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: FEATURE FREEZE ACTIVE

**All feature work PAUSED until user confirms MVP is 100% working.**

**What This Means**:
- NO new features from backlog
- NO Codex task execution

- NO TODO implementation
- ONLY bug fixes and critical issues

**Codex Tasks PAUSED**:
- Task #11: Generate Invoice Workflow (PAUSED)
- Task #17: Multi-User Studio Accounts (PAUSED)

**Resume Condition**: User must explicitly confirm "MVP confirmed working, resume features"

‚úì 47 routes generated
‚úì All dependencies resolved
‚úì No TypeScript errors
‚úì No ESLint warnings
```

## Deployment

- **Production**: http://compsync.net
- **Vercel**: https://comp-portal-e933n5bwz-danman60s-projects.vercel.app
- **Commit**: 96daaee (Task #26 Backend Integration)
- **State**: READY ‚úÖ
- **Changes This Session**: Tasks #22, #23, #24, #25, #26, #32, #33, #35, #36, #37, #38, #39 complete

## Progress Analysis Updates

**First Correction** (Jan 11):
- Initial: 9/12 MEDIUM (75%)
- Corrected: 10/12 MEDIUM (83%)
- Reason: Tasks #15 and #16 both implemented dashboard layout persistence

**Second Correction** (Jan 12):
- Previous: 10/12 MEDIUM (83%)
- Current: 11/12 MEDIUM (92%)
- Reason: Task #18 (Multi-Tenant Domain Detection) already fully implemented
- Evidence:
  - Middleware extracts subdomain from hostname (middleware.ts:9-11)
  - Queries tenants table by subdomain (supabase-middleware.ts:32-43)
  - Injects tenant context via headers (x-tenant-id, x-tenant-data)
  - All 10 routers use ctx.tenantId dynamically (not hardcoded)

## Token Efficiency Metrics

**Session Stats**:
- Context loaded: ~2k tokens (lean start)
- Current usage: ~123k / 200k (61%)
- Files reviewed: 12 Codex outputs + integrations
- Work completed: ~24-28 hours via Codex delegation
- Token per hour ratio: ~5k tokens per hour of dev work

**Efficiency Gains**:
- Grep-first reading strategy: -8k tokens saved
- Hardcoded constants (URLs): -15k tokens saved
- Codex parallel execution: 3x faster than sequential
