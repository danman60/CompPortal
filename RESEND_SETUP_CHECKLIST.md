# Resend Email Setup Checklist

**Created:** 2025-10-24 (Demo Prep)
**Updated:** 2025-10-24 (Email Fix Applied)
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - NEEDS PRODUCTION TEST

---

## ‚úÖ Code Implementation (COMPLETE)

### Resend Integration
- ‚úÖ `email.ts` migrated to Resend API (dd888a3)
- ‚úÖ Email logging to `email_logs` table
- ‚úÖ Success/error tracking
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback if API key missing
- ‚úÖ `.env.example` updated with `RESEND_API_KEY`

### Critical Bug Fix (2025-10-24 - Commit 4339ad7)
**Problem:** All email notifications were failing silently - not being logged to `email_logs` table and likely not sending.

**Root Cause:** All `sendEmail()` calls missing `templateType` parameter required for logging and tracking.

**Fix Applied:** Added `templateType`, `studioId`, and `competitionId` to all 9 critical email triggers.

### Email Triggers (NOW FIXED ‚úÖ)
All email triggers are wired up and call `sendEmail()` with proper templateType:
1. ‚úÖ Reservation submitted ‚Üí **CD notification** (reservation.ts:537)
2. ‚úÖ Reservation approved ‚Üí **SD notification** (reservation.ts:746)
3. ‚úÖ Reservation rejected ‚Üí **SD notification** (reservation.ts:856)
4. ‚úÖ Routine summary submitted ‚Üí **CD notification** (entry.ts:249)
5. ‚úÖ Invoice sent ‚Üí **SD notification** (invoice.ts:715)
6. ‚úÖ Entry submitted ‚Üí **SD notification** (entry.ts:883)
7. ‚úÖ Payment confirmed ‚Üí **SD notification** (invoice.ts:840)
8. ‚úÖ Payment confirmed (via reservation) ‚Üí **SD notification** (reservation.ts:1074)
9. ‚úÖ Studio profile submitted ‚Üí **CD notification** (studio.ts:240)

## üß™ Testing Email Delivery

### Method 1: Check Logs in Production

```typescript
// Query email_logs table
SELECT
  template_type,
  recipient_email,
  subject,
  success,
  error_message,
  created_at
FROM email_logs
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Expected:**
- `success = true` for sent emails
- `error_message = null` for successful sends

### Method 2: Resend Dashboard

1. Login to https://resend.com
2. Navigate to: Logs
3. Filter by: Last 24 hours
4. Verify emails appear in log
5. Check delivery status

### Method 3: Trigger Test Email

**Using Playwright MCP:**

```typescript
// Login as SD
await playwright.navigate('https://empwr.compsync.net/login');
await playwright.fill({ element: 'Email', ref: 'input[type="email"]', text: 'testsd1@test.com' });
await playwright.fill({ element: 'Password', ref: 'input[type="password"]', text: 'TestPassword123' });
await playwright.click({ element: 'Sign In', ref: 'button[type="submit"]' });

// Create reservation (triggers email)
await playwright.navigate('https://empwr.compsync.net/dashboard/reservations/new');
// ... fill form and submit

// Check database
const result = await supabase.execute_sql({
  query: "SELECT * FROM email_logs WHERE recipient_email = 'testsd1@test.com' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
});

// Should show success = true
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

**Check 1: Vercel Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, verify:
RESEND_API_KEY is set
EMAIL_FROM is set
```

**Check 2: Database Logs**
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_logs
WHERE success = false
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check 3: Application Logs**
```typescript
// email.ts line 18-19 logs warning if API key missing:
"Resend not configured (missing RESEND_API_KEY). Email disabled."
```

**Check 4: Resend Dashboard**
- Check API key is active
- Check domain is verified
- Check sending limits not exceeded

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Emails go to spam
**Solution:**
- Verify domain in Resend
- Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
- Use verified FROM address

**Issue:** API key invalid
**Solution:**
- Regenerate API key in Resend dashboard
- Update Vercel environment variable
- Redeploy

**Issue:** Rate limit exceeded
**Solution:**
- Check Resend dashboard for limits
- Upgrade plan if needed
- Implement rate limiting in app

## ‚úÖ Pre-Demo Verification Steps

### Monday Before Demo:

1. **Verify Vercel Env Vars:**
   - [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` is set
   - [ ] `EMAIL_FROM` is set
   - [ ] Both are in Production environment

2. **Trigger Test Email:**
   - [ ] Create test reservation
   - [ ] Check `email_logs` table shows `success = true`
   - [ ] Check Resend dashboard shows email sent
   - [ ] Check actual email received (if using real address)

3. **Test All Email Types:**
   - [ ] Reservation submitted email (to **CD** - new pending reservation)
   - [ ] Reservation approved email (to **SD** - approval confirmation)
   - [ ] Reservation rejected email (to **SD** - rejection notice)
   - [ ] Routine summary submitted email (to **CD** - ready to invoice)
   - [ ] Invoice sent email (to **SD** - invoice delivery)

4. **Document for Demo:**
   - [ ] Take screenshot of Resend dashboard showing successful delivery
   - [ ] Take screenshot of email_logs table
   - [ ] Prepare to show during demo

## üìã Demo Talking Points

**When showing email notifications:**

1. **Show the workflow:**
   - "When a studio submits a reservation, they receive an email confirmation"
   - "When we approve, they get another email with the details"
   - "When we send an invoice, it's emailed automatically with the PDF attached"

2. **Show the infrastructure:**
   - "We use Resend for reliable email delivery"
   - "Here's our email log showing successful deliveries" (show email_logs table)
   - "And here's the Resend dashboard confirming delivery" (show Resend UI)

3. **Highlight features:**
   - "All emails are logged for auditing"
   - "We track success/failure for each email"
   - "Users can control email preferences in their settings"
