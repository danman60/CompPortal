## Critical Bug Fix Verification Tests

### ✅ Fix #1: Routine Creation "Invalid Reservation ID" Error (BLOCKER)

**Original Issue**: Creating routine from approved reservation throws "Invalid reservation ID" error (Round 2 Test #6 - FAIL)
**Fix**: EntryForm now uses URL reservation ID directly instead of relying on find() (EntryForm.tsx:162)

**Test Steps**:

1. **Sign in as Studio Director** (demo.studio@gmail.com)
2. **Navigate to Reservations page** (Dashboard → My Reservations OR `/dashboard/reservations`)
3. **Locate an APPROVED reservation** with available spaces:
   - Look for green "APPROVED" badge
   - Routine counter shows "X/Y" with Y > X (e.g., "0/5", "3/10")
4. **Click "Create Routines" button**
5. **VERIFY**: Form loads correctly:
   - Competition pre-selected (dropdown locked/disabled)
   - Reservation pre-selected (dropdown locked/disabled)
   - Space counter shows "X of Y available spaces"
   - No errors in console (F12 DevTools)
6. **Fill in routine details**:
   - Routine Title: "QA Round 3 Test Routine"
   - Category: Any category
   - Age Group: Any
   - Classification: Any
   - Entry Size: Solo (or any)
   - Duration: 3:00
7. **Navigate through all 5 steps** of the wizard
8. **Click "Create Entry" on the Review step**
9. **VERIFY**: Success state:
   - ✅ Success message appears (NOT "Invalid reservation ID" error)
   - Redirects to entries list OR shows confirmation
   - No alert/modal with error
10. **Return to Reservations page**
11. **VERIFY**: Space counter decremented by 1
12. **Navigate to My Routines** (Dashboard → My Routines)
13. **VERIFY**: New routine "QA Round 3 Test Routine" appears in list

**Expected Result**: ✅ Routine created successfully without "Invalid reservation ID" error

**If FAIL**:
- Capture exact error message
- Check console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Screenshot the error modal/alert

**Status**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Evidence**: (Screenshot of success message + new routine in list)

### ✅ Fix #2: Invoice Auto-Generation on Approval (CRITICAL)

**Original Issue**: Approving reservation doesn't create invoice (Round 2 Test #2 - FAIL)
**Fix**: Removed try-catch swallowing errors, added entry_fee validation (reservation.ts:543-573)

**Test Steps**:

**Part A - Create Pending Reservation (if needed)**:

1. **Sign in as Studio Director** (demo.studio@gmail.com)
2. **Go to Reservations** → "+ Create Reservation"
3. **Select Competition**: "GlowDance Orlando 2025" (or any available event)
4. **Request Spaces**: 3 spaces
5. **Fill Agent Info**:
   - Agent Name: QA Test Agent
   - Agent Email: qa@test.com
   - Agent Phone: 555-1234
6. **Accept both checkboxes** (terms and pricing)
7. **Submit**
8. **VERIFY**: Reservation created with "PENDING" status (yellow badge)
9. **Note the reservation details** (competition name, spaces requested)
10. **Sign out**

**Part B - Approve Reservation & Verify Invoice**:

1. **Sign in as Competition Director** (demo.director@gmail.com)
2. **Go to Dashboard** → Click "Events" card
3. **Select the competition** from Part A (e.g., "GlowDance Orlando 2025")
4. **Scroll to Reservations section**
5. **Find the pending reservation** from Demo Dance Studio
6. **Click "Approve" button**
7. **Confirm spaces** (should match requested amount, e.g., 3)
8. **Click "Approve" in the confirmation dialog**
9. **VERIFY**: Reservation changes to "APPROVED" status (green badge)
10. **Immediately navigate to Invoices**: Dashboard → Click "Invoices" card
11. **VERIFY**: **NEW invoice appears** for Demo Dance Studio with:
    - Studio: Demo Dance Studio
    - Competition: GlowDance Orlando 2025 (the one just approved)
    - Line item: "Routine reservations (3 routines @ $X.XX each)" (matches approved spaces)
    - Status: UNPAID
    - Total: Correct calculation (3 × entry_fee)
12. **Click "View"** to open invoice detail
13. **VERIFY**: Invoice details populated correctly:
    - All fields have values (no "undefined" or blank fields)
    - Line items array shows correct quantity and pricing
    - Subtotal and Total match

**Expected Result**: ✅ Invoice auto-generated IMMEDIATELY after approval with correct line items

**Common Failure Modes**:
- ❌ No invoice created → Check server logs for entry_fee validation error
- ❌ Invoice created but wrong total → Check entry_fee in competition settings
- ❌ Invoice created but missing line items → Data structure issue

**Status**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Evidence**: (Screenshot of invoices list showing new invoice with correct details)

### ✅ Fix #3: Global Invoices Page Crash at /dashboard/invoices/all (BLOCKER)

**Original Issue**: Client-side exception causes blank screen at global invoices page (Round 2 Test #7 - FAIL)
**Fix**: Added null coalescing for all invoice fields (AllInvoicesList.tsx:202,208,244-264)

**Test Steps**:

1. **Sign in as Competition Director** (demo.director@gmail.com)
2. **Navigate to global invoices page**:
   - Option A: Dashboard → Click "Invoices" card → Click "View All Invoices" link
   - Option B: Direct URL: `/dashboard/invoices/all`
3. **VERIFY**: Page loads without crash:
   - ✅ No white screen
   - ✅ No blank page
   - ✅ No "Something went wrong" error
4. **VERIFY**: Page displays correctly:
   - Title: "Global Invoices"
   - Filter section with Event and Payment Status dropdowns
   - Summary stats cards (Total Invoices, Paid, Pending, Total Revenue)
   - Invoice table with columns: Studio, Event, Routines, Total Amount, Payment Status, Actions
5. **Check console** (F12 → Console tab):
   - **VERIFY**: No red errors
   - Yellow warnings are acceptable
6. **VERIFY**: Invoice table data displays:
   - Studio names display (NOT "undefined" or blank)
   - Studio codes display OR show "N/A" if null
   - City/Province display OR show "N/A" if null
   - Competition names display OR show "N/A" if null
   - Competition years display OR show 0 if null
   - Total amounts display as currency ($X.XX) OR show $0.00 if null
   - Payment status badges display (defaults to "PENDING" if null)
7. **Test filtering**:
   - Select different events from Event dropdown
   - Select different statuses from Payment Status dropdown
   - **VERIFY**: Filters work without crashes
8. **Test summary stats**:
   - **VERIFY**: All 4 stat cards show numbers (not NaN or undefined)
   - Total Revenue shows currency format
9. **Test actions**:
   - Click "View" on an invoice → Should navigate to detail page
   - Click "Mark Paid" → Should show prompt
   - Click "Send Reminder" → Should show confirmation

**Expected Result**: ✅ Page loads and displays all data correctly with proper null handling

**If FAIL**:
- Capture console errors (F12 → Console, copy full stack trace)
- Screenshot the error state
- Note which field/operation caused the crash

**Status**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Evidence**: (Screenshot of working global invoices page with table data)
