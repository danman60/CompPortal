## Recommendations

### For Phase 7 (Production Cutover):

2. âœ… **Data integrity verified** - Cross-page consistency confirmed
3. âœ… **Business logic validated** - Matches Phase 1 spec exactly
4. âœ… **No regressions found** - All functionality working as expected

### Suggested Cutover Steps:

1. Swap `/dashboard/entries` to rebuild version

4. Remove preview buttons from dashboards
5. Monitor for 24 hours
6. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
