### Bug #10: Missing Database Migration - two_factor_enabled ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Blocked notifications toggle functionality
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User testing in production)

**Error Message**:
```
Failed to update notifications:
Invalid `prisma.user_profiles.update()` invocation:
The column `user_profiles.two_factor_enabled` does not exist in the current database.
```

**Root Cause**:
- Two-factor authentication migration (20250113000003) was in schema.prisma but NOT applied to production database
- Code referenced `two_factor_enabled` column that didn't exist
- Migration file existed locally but was never run on production

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Settings page notifications toggle crashes with 500 error
- ‚ùå Users unable to enable/disable email notifications
- ‚ùå Profile updates fail if notifications preference changes

**Fix Applied**:
- Applied migration `add_two_factor_fields` to production database
- Added columns: `two_factor_enabled`, `two_factor_secret`, `two_factor_backup_codes`, `two_factor_verified_at`
- Created `two_factor_audit_log` table with RLS policies
- Migration applied successfully via Supabase MCP

**Verification**: ‚è≥ Pending - needs production test of notifications toggle

### Bug #12: React Hydration Error on Dashboard üî¥ ACTIVE
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Causes console errors, may affect functionality
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User navigating SD dashboard)

**Error Message**:
```
Uncaught Error: Minified React error #418
visit https://react.dev/errors/418?args[]=text&args[]= for full message
```

**Context**:
- Occurs when navigating back to Studio Director dashboard
- React error #418 = "Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server"
- Minified production build (harder to debug)

**Impact**:
- Console spam with errors
- Potential UI inconsistencies
- May cause unexpected behavior

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Identify which component is causing hydration mismatch
2. Check for:
   - Date/time rendering differences (server vs client)
   - Random values or UUIDs generated during render
   - Browser-only APIs called during SSR
   - Conditional rendering based on client-side state
3. Enable non-minified build for better error messages

**Common Hydration Causes**:
- `new Date()` called during render
- `Math.random()` during render
- Browser APIs (localStorage, window) in component body
- Suppressed hydration warnings with `suppressHydrationWarning`

### Bug #13: Fee Display on Routine Creation Page üî¥ ACTIVE
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Confusing UX, shows fee before submission
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User creating routine)
**URL**: https://www.compsync.net/dashboard/entries/create?competition=79cef00c-e163-449c-9f3c-d021fbb4d672&reservation=80404bd4-0407-407e-b370-caf8e496847e

**Issue**:
Per-routine summary shows fee amount during creation, but fees shouldn't be calculated/displayed until routine is submitted

**Expected Behavior**:
- Routine creation wizard should NOT show fee
- Fees calculated only after submission
- Invoice generated separately after submission

**Impact**:
- Confusing user experience
- Implies payment required before submission
- May discourage routine creation

**Fix Required**:
Remove fee display from routine creation wizard, show only after submission

### Bug #14: Group Size Auto-Detection Not Working üî¥ ACTIVE
**Severity**: HIGH - Core functionality broken
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User creating routine)
**URL**: Same as Bug #13

**Issue**:
When adding dancers to a routine, the group size category (Solo, Duet/Trio, Small Group, etc.) should auto-detect based on dancer count, but it's not working

**Expected Behavior**:
- 1 dancer = Solo
- 2-3 dancers = Duet/Trio
- 4-9 dancers = Small Group
- 10-19 dancers = Large Group
- etc.

**Current Behavior**:
Group size field remains empty/unchanged when dancers are added

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå User must manually select group size
- ‚ùå Risk of incorrect categorization
- ‚ùå Extra friction in routine creation

**Files to Check**:
- Routine creation form component
- Dancer selection handler
- Group size calculation logic

### Bug #15: React Error #419 After Routine Creation üî¥ ACTIVE
**Severity**: HIGH - Crashes after successful creation
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User creating routine)

**Error Message**:
```
Uncaught Error: Minified React error #419
visit https://react.dev/errors/419 for full message
```

**Context**:
- Error occurs AFTER routine is created successfully
- React error #419 = "Text content does not match server-rendered HTML"
- Related to hydration mismatch (similar to Bug #12)

**Impact**:
- Console errors after routine creation
- May prevent navigation or cause UI issues
- User experience degraded

**Investigation Needed**:
1. Check routine creation success handler
2. Review text rendering in post-creation components
3. Look for dynamic content that differs server/client
4. Check for whitespace differences in HTML

### Bug #16: Reservation Capacity Tracking Incorrect üî¥ CRITICAL
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Core business logic broken
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User viewing routines page)

**Issue**:
Routines page shows incorrect reservation capacity:
- **Actual**: 15 spaces (St. Catharines), 1 space (London)
- **Displayed**: "2/15 routines for London"

**Problems**:
1. Shows wrong competition (London instead of St. Catharines)
2. Counts incorrectly (showing 2 routines when only 1 space allocated)
3. Capacity tracking completely wrong

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå CRITICAL: Users can't trust capacity information
- ‚ùå May allow over-booking
- ‚ùå May prevent legitimate bookings
- ‚ùå Financial impact (incorrect routine counts)

**Investigation Required**:
1. Check reservation capacity query
2. Verify competition ID matching
3. Review routine count calculation
4. Check database for correct reservation data

**Database Verification Needed**:
```sql
SELECT r.id, r.requested_spots, r.allocated_spots,
       c.name as competition_name
FROM reservations r
JOIN competitions c ON r.competition_id = c.id
WHERE r.studio_id = (SELECT id FROM studios WHERE owner_id = ...)
```

### Bug #17: Competition Dropdown Missing St. Catharines üî¥ CRITICAL
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks routine creation for approved reservation
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User attempting routine creation)

**Issue**:
User has approved reservation for St. Catharines (15 spaces) but St. Catharines doesn't appear in competition dropdown on routines page

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå CRITICAL: Cannot create routines for largest reservation
- ‚ùå Blocks entire workflow for approved studios
- ‚ùå 15 paid spots unusable

**Expected Behavior**:
Dropdown should show ALL competitions where user has approved reservations

**Current Behavior**:
St. Catharines competition missing from dropdown despite active, approved reservation

**Investigation Required**:
1. Check competition dropdown query/filter logic
2. Verify reservation status check
3. Review competition active/published status
4. Check for date filtering that might exclude competition

### Bug #18: Routines Not Marked as Submitted üî¥ CRITICAL
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Data integrity issue
**Discovered**: 2025-10-23 (User after routine submission)

**Issue**:
After submitting routine, user can go back to routines page and submit ANOTHER routine. Previously submitted routines are not marked as "submitted" and remain in editable/submittable state.

**Problems**:
1. Duplicate submissions possible
2. Routine status not updating after submission
3. No distinction between draft and submitted routines
4. User confusion about what's been submitted

**Expected Behavior**:
- After submission, routine status should change to "submitted" or "registered"
- Submitted routines should not be editable
- Submitted routines should not show "Submit" button again
- Clear visual distinction between draft and submitted

**Current Behavior**:
- All routines appear as drafts
- Can "submit" same routine multiple times
- No status change after submission

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå CRITICAL: Duplicate routine submissions
- ‚ùå Data integrity issues
- ‚ùå Invoice calculation errors
- ‚ùå Competition entry count errors

**Database Check Required**:
```sql
SELECT id, status, created_at, updated_at
FROM competition_entries
WHERE reservation_id = ...
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

**Files to Investigate**:
- Routine submission handler
- Entry status update logic
- Routines list query (status filter)
- Entry status field definition

JOIN studios s ON r.studio_id = s.id
WHERE s.owner_id = (SELECT id FROM user_profiles WHERE users.email = 'danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com')
ORDER BY c.name;

-- Check routine entries and their status
SELECT e.id, e.status, e.routine_name, e.created_at,
       c.name as competition_name,
       r.allocated_spots as reservation_capacity
FROM competition_entries e
JOIN competitions c ON e.competition_id = c.id
