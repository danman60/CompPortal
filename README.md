# GlowDance Competition Portal

A modern, white-label dance competition registration and management platform rebuilt from legacy systems with contemporary web technologies.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a complete modernization of a dance competition portal, transforming a legacy system using outdated technologies (jQuery 1.4.2, Blueprint CSS, XHTML 1.0) into a modern, responsive web application.

### Current Status: Analysis & Design Phase COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ **Legacy System Analysis Complete** - Scraped and analyzed 18 pages of the existing portal
- ✅ **Enterprise Export System Analysis** - Analyzed 5 export formats revealing professional-grade event management
- ✅ **Technical Blueprint Created** - Comprehensive 50+ page rebuild strategy documented
- ✅ **Modern UI Samples** - Login and dashboard mockups created with glassmorphism design
- ✅ **Database Schema Designed** - PostgreSQL schema ready for enterprise-scale implementation
- ✅ **Technology Stack Selected** - Next.js 14, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma modern stack chosen
- 🟡 **Ready for Development** - Phase 1 MVP development can begin immediately
