**Why**: Competition schedules, reports, certificates need PDF export
**Alternative**: API services like PDF.co

### Important (Phase 2)

#### State Management
**Recommended**: Zustand + React Query (TanStack Query)
**Why**: Client-side state + server state caching, optimistic updates

#### Form Management
**Recommended**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
**Why**: Type-safe forms, excellent validation, performance

#### Testing
**Recommended**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
**Why**: Fast testing, great TypeScript support

#### Error Monitoring
**Recommended**: Sentry

## üö® Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

#### 1. Data Migration from Demo to Real Schema
**Risk**: Demo data structure doesn't match Supabase schema
**Mitigation**:
- Create migration scripts early
- Test with sample data
- Validate schema alignment weekly

#### 2. Authentication Security
**Risk**: Improper authentication implementation could expose data
**Mitigation**:
- Use battle-tested NextAuth.js
- Implement RLS in Supabase
- Security audit before production
- Regular penetration testing

#### 3. Capacity Management
**Risk**: Overbooking competitions due to race conditions
**Mitigation**:
- Implement database-level constraints
- Use transactions for reservation creation
- Add optimistic locking
- Real-time capacity monitoring

#### 4. Schedule Generation Complexity
**Risk**: Algorithm fails with large data sets (387+ performances)
**Mitigation**:
- Implement early with test data
- Profile performance continuously
- Use background jobs for generation
- Add manual override capability

#### 5. Email Delivery
**Risk**: Critical notifications not delivered
**Mitigation**:
- Use reliable service (Resend)
- Implement retry logic
- Log all email attempts
- Add webhook monitoring

### Medium Risk Areas

#### 1. File Upload Limits
**Risk**: Large dancer photos cause storage issues
**Mitigation**: Image optimization, size limits, compression

#### 2. Export Performance
**Risk**: PDF generation slow with large schedules
**Mitigation**: Background job processing, caching

#### 3. Mobile Performance
**Risk**: Complex forms slow on mobile
**Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, lazy loading

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The CompPortal project has an excellent foundation with a complete database schema, well-designed UI components, and comprehensive documentation. The primary gap is the **backend implementation** - converting static demo pages into a fully functional application with real data persistence, authentication, and business logic.

This roadmap provides a **systematic, phased approach** to bridge that gap over 12-16 weeks, prioritizing user journeys and ensuring each phase delivers measurable value. The recommended tech stack (Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + Supabase) aligns with modern best practices and provides excellent developer experience while maintaining production-grade reliability.

**Recommendation**: Begin Phase 1 immediately with project setup and authentication implementation. This foundation will enable rapid development of subsequent phases.
