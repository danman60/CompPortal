## üõ†Ô∏è Missing Tech Stack Components

### Critical (Must Have for MVP)

#### Backend Framework
**Current**: None
**Recommended**: Next.js 14+ App Router with API Routes
**Why**: Full-stack framework, seamless frontend integration, excellent TypeScript support
**Alternative**: Express.js + React (more complex deployment)

#### API Layer
**Current**: None
**Recommended**: tRPC
**Why**: Type-safe APIs, automatic client generation, excellent DX
**Alternative**: REST API with OpenAPI/Swagger

#### ORM/Database Client
**Current**: Demo client with mock data
**Recommended**: Prisma ORM
**Why**: Type-safe database access, excellent migrations, great with Next.js
**Alternative**: Direct Supabase client (less type safety)

#### Authentication
**Current**: localStorage demo
**Recommended**: NextAuth.js v5
**Why**: Battle-tested, multiple providers, JWT support, session management
**Alternative**: Supabase Auth (simpler but less flexible)

#### File Storage
**Current**: None
**Recommended**: Supabase Storage or AWS S3
**Why**: Dancer photos, documents, PDFs need reliable storage
**Alternative**: Cloudinary (better for images)

#### Email Service
**Current**: None
**Recommended**: Resend
**Why**: Modern API, excellent DX, reliable delivery, transactional emails
**Alternative**: SendGrid (more established, higher complexity)

#### PDF Generation
**Current**: None
**Recommended**: Puppeteer or jsPDF
**Why**: Competition schedules, reports, certificates need PDF export
**Alternative**: API services like PDF.co

### Important (Phase 2)

#### State Management
**Recommended**: Zustand + React Query (TanStack Query)
**Why**: Client-side state + server state caching, optimistic updates

#### Form Management
**Recommended**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
**Why**: Type-safe forms, excellent validation, performance

#### Testing
**Recommended**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
**Why**: Fast testing, great TypeScript support

#### Error Monitoring
**Recommended**: Sentry
**Why**: Production error tracking, performance monitoring

#### Payment Processing
**Recommended**: Stripe
**Why**: Competition entry fees, reservation payments

## üö® Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

#### 1. Data Migration from Demo to Real Schema
**Risk**: Demo data structure doesn't match Supabase schema
**Mitigation**:
- Create migration scripts early
- Test with sample data
- Validate schema alignment weekly

#### 2. Authentication Security
**Risk**: Improper authentication implementation could expose data
**Mitigation**:
- Use battle-tested NextAuth.js
- Implement RLS in Supabase
- Security audit before production
- Regular penetration testing

#### 3. Capacity Management
**Risk**: Overbooking competitions due to race conditions
**Mitigation**:
- Implement database-level constraints
- Use transactions for reservation creation
- Add optimistic locking
- Real-time capacity monitoring

#### 4. Schedule Generation Complexity
**Risk**: Algorithm fails with large data sets (387+ performances)
**Mitigation**:
- Implement early with test data
- Profile performance continuously
- Use background jobs for generation
- Add manual override capability

#### 5. Email Delivery
**Risk**: Critical notifications not delivered
**Mitigation**:
- Use reliable service (Resend)
- Implement retry logic
- Log all email attempts
- Add webhook monitoring

### Medium Risk Areas

#### 1. File Upload Limits
**Risk**: Large dancer photos cause storage issues
**Mitigation**: Image optimization, size limits, compression

#### 2. Export Performance
**Risk**: PDF generation slow with large schedules
**Mitigation**: Background job processing, caching

#### 3. Mobile Performance
**Risk**: Complex forms slow on mobile
**Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, lazy loading

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The CompPortal project has an excellent foundation with a complete database schema, well-designed UI components, and comprehensive documentation. The primary gap is the **backend implementation** - converting static demo pages into a fully functional application with real data persistence, authentication, and business logic.

This roadmap provides a **systematic, phased approach** to bridge that gap over 12-16 weeks, prioritizing user journeys and ensuring each phase delivers measurable value. The recommended tech stack (Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + Supabase) aligns with modern best practices and provides excellent developer experience while maintaining production-grade reliability.

**Recommendation**: Begin Phase 1 immediately with project setup and authentication implementation. This foundation will enable rapid development of subsequent phases.
