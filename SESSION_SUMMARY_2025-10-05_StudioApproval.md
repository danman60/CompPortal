## 🔧 Technical Details

### Email Data Construction

```typescript
// Approval email
const profile = studio.users_studios_owner_idTousers.user_profiles;
const ownerName = profile && (profile.first_name || profile.last_name)
  ? `${profile.first_name || ''} ${profile.last_name || ''}`.trim()
  : undefined;

const emailData: StudioApprovedData = {
  studioName: studio.name,
  ownerName,
  portalUrl: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/dashboard`,
};
```

### Schema Integration

```typescript
// Prisma include to fetch owner data
include: {
  users_studios_owner_idTousers: {
    select: {
      id: true,
      email: true,
      user_profiles: {
        select: {
          first_name: true,
          last_name: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control

```typescript
// Only CD and SA can approve/reject
if (isStudioDirector(ctx.userRole)) {
  throw new Error('Studio directors cannot approve studios');
}
```

### Email Error Handling

```typescript
// Graceful failure - email errors don't block operations
try {
  await sendEmail({ to, subject, html });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to send approval email:', error);
  // Don't throw - email failure shouldn't block the approval
}
```

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Implementation

### Bug: Missing `auth-utils.ts` File
- **Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/auth-utils'`
- **Cause**: Referenced utility file in studio.ts but never created it
- **Fix**: Created `src/lib/auth-utils.ts` with all role helper functions

### Bug: Invalid Field `full_name` in users Table
- **Error**: `Unknown field 'full_name' for select statement on model 'users'`
- **Cause**: Attempted to select non-existent `full_name` field from users table
- **Fix**: Changed to use `user_profiles` relation with `first_name` and `last_name`

## 📊 Testing Results

### Compilation Testing
- ✅ Dev server starts without errors

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Always create helper files before referencing them** - Created auth-utils.ts after import errors
2. **Verify schema structure before writing queries** - Had to fix user_profiles relation
3. **Test email data construction carefully** - Owner name concatenation needed null checks
4. **Dev server restart needed for new files** - HMR doesn't pick up new utility files
5. **Email failures should be logged, not thrown** - Graceful degradation is critical

---

## 💡 Technical Decisions

### Why user_profiles Instead of users Table?
The `users` table (from Supabase Auth) doesn't have name fields. User profile data lives in the `user_profiles` table with a 1:1 relation. This is the correct Supabase Auth pattern.

### Why Graceful Email Failures?
Studio approval/rejection should succeed even if email sending fails. The database state is the source of truth. Email failures are logged for debugging but don't block the operation.

### Why Separate Approve/Reject Mutations?
Different operations require different data (rejection needs reason, approval doesn't). Separate mutations provide clearer intent and better type safety.

### Why Filter Tabs Default to "Pending"?
Admins primarily need to act on pending studios. Starting with the "Pending" tab reduces clicks and improves workflow efficiency.
