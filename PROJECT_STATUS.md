## Current Status: üü¢ CAPACITY SYSTEM REWRITTEN - Ready for Testing

### Latest Work: Session 9 - Surgical Capacity System Rewrite

**Date:** October 24, 2025 (4:00pm-6:00pm EST)
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete architectural rewrite deployed (commits 6d84795, 917c3b0)

**MAJOR CHANGES:**
1. ‚úÖ **CapacityService class** - Single source of truth with atomic transactions
2. ‚úÖ **capacity_ledger table** - Complete audit trail for all capacity changes
3. ‚úÖ **Idempotency protection** - Prevents double-deductions from duplicate API calls
4. ‚úÖ **Admin debugging tools** - Super admin can view ledger, reconcile capacity
5. ‚úÖ **Approve mutation rewritten** - Uses CapacityService.reserve()
6. ‚úÖ **Summary mutation rewritten** - Uses CapacityService.refund()

**Previous Work: Session 8 - Email Notifications & Capacity Double-Deduction**

**Date:** October 24, 2025 (10:30am-3:30pm EST)
**Duration:** 5 hours
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Bandaid fixes replaced by surgical rewrite in Session 9

**Problems Solved:**
1. ‚úÖ Email notifications completely blocked (root cause: uncaught capacity error)
2. ‚úÖ Catastrophic capacity double-deduction (75 spaces ‚Üí 150 deducted)
3. ‚úÖ Schema mismatch causing entry creation failures
4. ‚úÖ Database wiped and reset for clean testing

**Awaiting User Testing:**
- Email delivery verification (RESEND_API_KEY confirmed set)
- Capacity math accuracy (should be exactly 75 deducted)
- Logging verification (email_logs and activity_logs should populate)

**See:** `CAPACITY_REWRITE_PLAN.md` for complete surgical rewrite architecture

## üìä Session 9 Summary - Capacity System Surgical Rewrite

**Environment:** https://www.compsync.net (Production)
**Approach:** Complete architectural rewrite following CAPACITY_REWRITE_PLAN.md
**Result:** Atomic, auditable, idempotent capacity management

### What Was Built

**1. CapacityService Class (src/server/services/capacity.ts)**
- `reserve()` - Atomic capacity deduction with idempotency check
- `refund()` - Atomic capacity refund with validation
- `getAvailable()` - Real-time capacity query
- `getLedger()` - Audit trail viewer
- `reconcile()` - Verify ledger matches current state

**Key Features:**
- Database transactions with row locking (prevents race conditions)
- Idempotency protection (checks capacity_ledger before reserve)
- Audit trail (every change logged with reason + timestamp)
- Validation (prevents over-refunding, insufficient capacity)

**2. capacity_ledger Table (Migration via Supabase MCP)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE capacity_ledger (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  competition_id UUID REFERENCES competitions(id),
  reservation_id UUID REFERENCES reservations(id),
  change_amount INT,  -- Negative = deduction, Positive = refund
  reason VARCHAR(50), -- 'reservation_approval', 'summary_refund', etc
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);
```

**3. Mutations Rewritten**
- **Approve mutation** (reservation.ts:662-680)
  - Old: Manual prisma.competitions.update with try/catch
  - New: capacityService.reserve() with transaction + audit
  - Benefit: Idempotency prevents double-deduction bug

- **Summary mutation** (entry.ts:197-216)
  - Old: Manual prisma.competitions.update in transaction
  - New: capacityService.refund() with validation + audit
  - Benefit: Can now debug "where did refund go?"

**4. Admin Tools** (admin.ts:28-85)
- `getCapacityLedger` - View all capacity changes for competition
- `getAvailableCapacity` - Real-time capacity check
- `reconcileCapacity` - Verify ledger integrity

**Super Admin only** - Debug tools for troubleshooting capacity issues

### Bugs Fixed

**Bug #1: Double-Deduction (User reported: 100 spaces ‚Üí 200 deducted)**
- **Root Cause:** No idempotency protection, approve called twice
- **Fix:** CapacityService checks capacity_ledger before reserve
- **Result:** Silent skip if reservation already processed

**Bug #2: Refund Not Persisting (User reported: "99 spaces warning but didn't refund")**
- **Root Cause:** Scattered logic, no audit trail to debug
- **Fix:** CapacityService.refund() with atomic transaction
- **Result:** Refund logged in capacity_ledger, can verify it happened

**Bug #3: No Audit Trail**
- **Root Cause:** No way to answer "where did capacity go?"
- **Fix:** capacity_ledger table logs every change
- **Result:** Can query ledger to see exact history

### Files Changed

- `src/server/services/capacity.ts` - NEW (268 lines)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added capacity_ledger model
- `src/server/routers/reservation.ts` - Approve mutation rewritten
- `src/server/routers/entry.ts` - Summary mutation rewritten
- `src/server/routers/admin.ts` - Added 3 capacity debug queries
- `CAPACITY_REWRITE_PLAN.md` - Complete architecture documentation

### Commits

- `6d84795` - feat: Implement CapacityService with atomic transactions
- `917c3b0` - feat: Add admin tools for capacity debugging

## üìä Session 8 Summary - Email & Capacity Crisis

**Environment:** https://www.compsync.net (Production)
**Testing Method:** Incognito browser, fresh deploys, SQL verification
**Result:** 4 critical fixes, clean database, ready for testing

### Critical Fixes Deployed (Commit 68e421e)

**Fix #1: Email Notification Blocking (commit 86f21a4)**
- **Problem:** NO email_logs, NO activity_logs despite approvals working
- **Root Cause:** Uncaught error in capacity update killing function execution before email code
- **Solution:** Wrapped capacity update in try/catch block
- **Files:** reservation.ts:689-707
- **Impact:** Email and logging code now executes even if capacity update fails

**Fix #2: Double-Capacity Deduction (commit 967028c)**
- **Problem:** 75-space reservation deducted 150 spaces (298‚Üí448)
- **Evidence:** St. Cath #1 showing 318 extra spaces deducted (130 actual vs 448 shown)
- **Root Cause:** Re-approval of already-approved reservations deducting again
- **Solution:** Only decrement if existingReservation.status === 'pending'
- **Files:** reservation.ts:690-710
- **Impact:** Capacity deducted exactly once per reservation approval

**Fix #3: Entry Creation Schema Mismatch (commit 68e421e)**
- **Problem:** "column routine_number does not exist in the current database"
- **User Clarification:** "routine number is for a later function to do with scheduling"
- **Solution:** Added routine_number column to database via migration + restored to schema
- **Files:** prisma/schema.prisma:448, migration file
- **Impact:** Entry creation now works, scheduling feature preserved

**Fix #4: Schedule Builder Field Mapping (commit 4ff7d7b)**
- **Problem:** Trying to update competition_entries.routine_number which doesn't exist for that purpose
- **Solution:** Changed to competition_entries.entry_number (correct field)
- **Files:** scheduleBuilder.ts:279
- **Impact:** Schedule locking will work correctly when feature is used

### Database State Reset
- ‚úÖ Test database completely wiped
- ‚úÖ All competition capacities reset to 600/600
- ‚úÖ 4 competitions, 2 user profiles exist
- ‚úÖ 0 studios, 0 reservations (clean slate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Seed function broken (manual testing required)

### User Frustration Points
- Regression concerns: "honestly i'm very frsutrated at all the regression and tiny bugs"
- Schema sync fatigue: "We've literally already done a DB schema sync cleanup, but I guess we have to do it again"
- Context confusion: "WHO THE FUCK WAS TALKING ABOUT SCHEDULE LOCKING" (I was looking at wrong code)

## üéØ Reservation Lifecycle (Complete Flow)

1. **SD creates reservation** ‚Üí Requests X spaces
2. **CD approves reservation** ‚Üí Confirms Y spaces (deducts tokens ONCE)
3. **SD creates routines** ‚Üí Builds up to Y routines (draft/registered)
4. **SD submits summary** ‚Üí Routines become 'confirmed'
   - If confirmed count Z < Y:
     - Refund (Y - Z) tokens to competition
     - Set `is_closed = true`
     - Reservation locked, SD must create new one
5. **CD generates invoice** ‚Üí Only confirmed routines included
6. **Invoice sent** ‚Üí Locked from editing (is_locked = true)
7. **Invoice marked PAID** ‚Üí Locked permanently

## üìà Next Session Priorities - VERIFICATION REQUIRED

### üéØ **IMMEDIATE - Testing Session Required**

**User must verify fixes work:**

1. **Test email delivery** (15 minutes)
   - Create SD account and studio
   - Create reservation for 75 spaces
   - Approve as CD
   - Verify email arrives
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM email_logs ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 1;`
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM activity_logs WHERE action = 'reservation.approve' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;`

2. **Verify capacity math** (5 minutes)
   - Before approval: `SELECT available_reservation_tokens FROM competitions WHERE name = 'St. Cath #1';` (should be 600)
   - After approval: Should be 525 (exactly 75 deducted)
   - Not 450 (double-deduction bug would show this)

3. **Test routine space refunding** (20 minutes)
   - Approve reservation for 100 spaces (capacity: 600 ‚Üí 500)
   - Create 75 routines as SD
   - Submit routine summary
   - Verify capacity: 500 ‚Üí 525 (25 refunded)
   - Verify reservation.is_closed = true
