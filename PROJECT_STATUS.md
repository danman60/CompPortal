**Latest Update**: Converted demo to live Supabase integration with real database connection (Commit: 538e478)

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

### **What We're Building**
The GlowDance Competition Portal is a **complete modernization** of an enterprise-grade dance competition management platform. This isn't just a simple registration system‚Äîit's a sophisticated **event production platform** that manages multi-day, multi-venue dance competitions with 387+ individual performances, elite championships, and professional production coordination.

### **Business Impact & Scale**
- **26+ dance studios** across multiple provinces/states (Canada & US)
- **387+ individual performances** in a single competition event
- **6-day multi-venue events** including competition halls, waterpark venues, and gala locations
- **Elite championship management** with specialized "Glow-Off" competitions and title rounds
- **Professional production coordination** including video, sound, backstage, and entertainment management
- **Revenue optimization** through VIP experiences and premium event coordination

### **Why This Rebuild is Critical**
The legacy system uses **dangerously outdated technologies**:
- jQuery 1.4.2 (2010) with severe security vulnerabilities
- XHTML 1.0 Transitional (deprecated)
- Blueprint CSS (obsolete)
- No mobile responsiveness
- Poor accessibility
- Significant technical debt

## üìã **NEW: Stakeholder Requirements (October 2025)**

### **Meeting Outcomes & Product Vision**
**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Participants**: Daniel (Product Owner), Emily (Competition Director), Mike (Technical Lead)
**Document**: See `MEETING_REQUIREMENTS_2025-10-01.md` for complete details

### **Bootstrap MVP Strategy (Year 1)**
**Philosophy**: Manual workflows acceptable to get system operational quickly
- Manual payment processing (e-transfer) acceptable for Year 1
- Manual invoice adjustments by directors (no automated discounts initially)
- Manual reservation approvals (not auto-approved)
- Focus on core workflows over automation

### **Key Requirements Captured**

#### **Core Registration System (P0 - Critical)**
1. **Self-Service Studio Registration**: Studios create own accounts without admin intervention
2. **Reservation/Allocation System**: Studios reserve X entries, directors approve, system enforces limits
3. **Dancer Database**: Bulk CSV import + individual entry, age auto-calculation from birthdate
4. **Routine Registration**: Link dancers to routines, track props/duration/genre, finalize before deadline
5. **Invoice Generation**: Auto-generate invoices, directors manually adjust pricing, e-transfer payment tracking

#### **Admin Dashboard (P0 - Critical)**
6. **Studio Management View**: See all studios, reservations, entries, payment status
7. **Capacity Management**: Set competition max (e.g., 600 entries), real-time tracking, alert at 90%
8. **Multi-Competition Support**: Separate GLOW and EMPWR instances, ~8 events/year, easy rebranding

#### **Scheduling System (P1 - High)**
9. **Conflict Detection**: Auto-detect same dancer in multiple routines too close together, costume change time
10. **Schedule Generation**: Auto-generate schedule with specific times, optimize for minimal conflicts
11. **Schedule Reports**: PDF exports (studio-specific, master, per-dancer), email distribution

#### **Music Management (P1 - High)**
12. **Music Upload Portal**: Studios upload MP3s per routine, deadline tracking, missing music alerts
13. **Playlist Generation**: Combine all music in schedule order, send to backstage music person
14. **Music Coordinator View**: Track upload status, send reminders, export status report

#### **Tabulation System (P1 - High)**
15. **Judge Interface**: Tablet-based scoring (web app), sliders/input fields, offline-capable
16. **Live Score Sync**: Real-time sync to database, aggregate scores, calculate standings
17. **Scoring Data Management**: Store all scores, detect anomalies, generate rankings

#### **Report Generation (P1 - High)**
18. **Competition Day Reports**: Real-time standings, award placements, printable formats
19. **Studio Reports**: Per-studio summaries, routine placements, scores, email post-competition

#### **Email Notifications (P1 - High)**
20. **Automated Emails**: Registration confirmation, reservation status, invoices, schedules, music reminders

#### **Future (Year 2+ / Not MVP)**
- Stripe integration for online payments (Year 2)
- Media delivery portal (separate project)
- Convention registration module (separate project)
- Mobile judge apps (optional)

### **Scale & Performance Requirements**
- **~60 studios** across all competitions
- **600-800 entries** per competition weekend
- **~8 competitions per year**
- **Multiple dancers per routine** (1-20+ for groups)
- **Multi-venue support** (competition halls, waterparks, gala venues)

### **Critical Success Factors**
- **Competition Day Reliability**: Zero downtime during live events
- **Scheduling Accuracy**: Zero conflict scenarios, realistic time allocations
- **Music Workflow**: 100% music collection before deadlines
- **Judge Experience**: Tablet scoring must work flawlessly (backup paper scorecards)
- **Director Time Savings**: 20+ hours saved per competition vs. legacy system
