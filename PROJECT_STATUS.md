# CompPortal Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25 (Session 14 - Build Fix)

## Current Status: Phase 1 Summary Workflow - 100% Complete

### Latest Work: Session 14 - Build Fix for Reservation Variables

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Fixed build errors from Session 13 refactor

**BUILD ERRORS FIXED:**
- Line 546: `hasApprovedReservations` ‚Üí `hasSelectedReservation`
- Line 548: `approvedCompetitionId` ‚Üí `selectedCompetitionId` + `reservation.id`
- Line 680: `hasSelectedCompetition` ‚Üí `hasSelectedReservation`
- Line 682: `competitions.find()` ‚Üí `selectedReservation.event_name`

**Root Cause:** Session 13 refactor to reservation-based filtering missed updating two locations:
1. FloatingActionButton (mobile Create Routine button)
2. Summary modal header displaying event name

**Commit:** 781797d - fix: Update EntriesList to use reservation variables

### Previous Session: Session 13 - Reservation-Based UI Refactor

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED - Complete UI refactor for reservation-based workflow

**MAJOR UI CHANGES - SD ENTRIES PAGE:**

**Replaced Competition Filtering with Reservation Selection:**
- Created new `ReservationSelector` component replacing `CompetitionFilter`
- Shows approved + summarized reservations in dropdown
- Event names with ordinal suffixes for duplicates (e.g., "St. Catharines 1 - 2nd")
- Displays "(closed)" indicator for summarized reservations
- Entries now filter by `reservation_id` instead of `competition_id`

**Submit Summary Enhancements:**
- Moved button to far right in header (prominent green gradient with pulse animation)
- Added incomplete warning modal requiring "Submit Anyway" confirmation
- Removed non-working buttons from bottom Live Summary bar
- Centered Live Summary stats display

**Closed Reservation Handling:**
- Blocks "Create Routine" button with explanatory tooltip
- Allows editing existing routines (page 2 details only)
- Prevents creating new routines after summary submission

**Status Filter Cleanup:**
- Removed all/draft/registered/confirmed/cancelled filter buttons
- Simplified UI to focus on reservation selection

**CD PIPELINE FIX:**
- Fixed "Pending Invoice" filter to show `status='summarized'` reservations
- Previously only showed `status='approved'` with entries (wrong!)
- Summarized reservations now correctly appear ready for invoicing

**Files Changed:**
- NEW: `src/components/ReservationSelector.tsx` (106 lines)
- MODIFIED: `src/components/EntriesList.tsx` (reservation-based filtering)
- MODIFIED: `src/hooks/useEntryFilters.ts` (filter by reservation)
- MODIFIED: `src/hooks/useSpaceUsage.ts` (accept reservation object, added isClosed flag)
- MODIFIED: `src/components/ReservationPipeline.tsx` (fix Pending Invoice filter)

**Commit:** 48a9ac7 - feat: Refactor entries list to use reservation-based filtering

**Date:** October 25, 2025 (14:00-16:30 UTC)
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - 6 fixes deployed, root cause confirmed

**BLOCKER RESOLVED:**
- Symptom: UI showed success but database had zero changes (silent transaction rollback)
- Root Cause (PRIMARY): UI event interference from bottom submit button
- Root Cause (SECONDARY): Transaction client mixing (`logActivity()` using global `prisma` inside `tx` block)

**ALL 6 FIXES:**
1. ‚úÖ Fix #1 (bf54ce8) - Inlined capacity refund
2. ‚úÖ Fix #2 (b969e51) - Scoped getSummary to reservation
3. ‚úÖ Fix #3 (5911723) - Expanded entry select for snapshot
4. ‚úÖ Fix #4 (1c0c446) - **CRITICAL** - Moved logActivity outside transaction
5. ‚úÖ Fix #5 (cee8265) - Enhanced transaction logging
6. ‚úÖ Fix #6 (d22bbd9) - **KEY FIX** - Header button bypasses UI interference

**Production Verification (3 successful tests):**
- ‚úÖ Summaries created
- ‚úÖ Reservations closed (`is_closed=true`, `status='summarized'`)
- ‚úÖ Capacity refunded (+249, +298, +49 tokens)

**Documentation:** `BLOCKER_RESERVATION_CLOSURE.md` (231 lines)
