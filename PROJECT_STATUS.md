## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes (11 Total)

### Critical Reservation & CSV Issues:
1. **"Deny Reservation" button not working** - Added onClick handler + reject mutation with modal UI (ReservationPipeline.tsx:534-538, 82-91, 217-232, 742-789)
2. **Token refund logic broken** - Verified already working in reject/cancel mutations (reservation.ts)
3. **Event capacity card data incorrect** - Fixed to use live `reservation_tokens` instead of static values (ReservationPipeline.tsx:107-109)
4. **Studio CSV upload 406 error** - Increased body size limit from 2MB to 10MB (next.config.js:53)
5. **Routine CSV import JSZip error** - Added better error handling for corrupted Excel files (RoutineCSVImport.tsx:304-334)

### Financial & Access Control:
6. **Studio Directors editing invoices** - Added role checks to prevent unauthorized edits (InvoiceDetail.tsx:71, 324-368)
7. **Mark as Paid security** - Verified already restricted to Competition Directors only
8. **Hardcoded 13% HST tax** - Removed dynamic tax rate, now always 13% (invoice.ts:194)
9. **Manual Payment Only banner** - Added clear offline payment indication (InvoiceDetail.tsx:127-133)

### Database Schema:
10. **Deposit tracking fields** - Added `deposit_paid_at`, `deposit_confirmed_by`, `is_closed` to reservations
11. **Invoice fields** - Added `credit_amount`, `credit_reason`, `tax_rate`, `is_locked` to invoices

### Export Functionality:
12. **CSV Export for Dancers** - Added export button with full dancer data (dancers/page.tsx:16-53, 109-115)
13. **CSV Export for Routines** - Added export button with complete routine details (EntriesList.tsx:181-226)

## üöß Remaining High Priority Issues

From EMPWR testing, still requiring implementation:

1. **Auto-close reservations** - Needs backend trigger when fewer routines submitted than reserved
   - Database field ready: `is_closed` added
   - Logic needed: Detect routine count < spaces_confirmed, set is_closed=true, refund tokens

2. **Invoice lock after send** - Prevent modifications after invoice sent
   - Database field ready: `is_locked` added
   - Needs: Enforcement in update mutations

3. **Invoice should only include confirmed routines** - Filter by status
   - Current: Includes all non-cancelled entries
   - Needs: Modify invoice generation to filter for confirmed entries only

4. **Hide individual routine pricing in summary** - Only show total
   - Status: Need to locate where prices are displayed to users
   - May have already been removed

**Environment:** https://empwr.compsync.net
**Status:** Deploying (commit 3a1f022)
**Previous Deployment:** Failed (TypeScript error in EntriesList.tsx:198)
