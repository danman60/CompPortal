## Current Status: üî¥ AWAITING VERIFICATION - Critical Bugs Fixed

### Latest Work: Session 8 - Email Notifications & Capacity Double-Deduction

**Date:** October 24, 2025 (10:30am-3:30pm EST)
**Duration:** 5 hours
**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes deployed to production (commit 68e421e)

**Problems Solved:**
1. ‚úÖ Email notifications completely blocked (root cause: uncaught capacity error)
2. ‚úÖ Catastrophic capacity double-deduction (75 spaces ‚Üí 150 deducted)
3. ‚úÖ Schema mismatch causing entry creation failures
4. ‚úÖ Database wiped and reset for clean testing

**Awaiting User Testing:**
- Email delivery verification (RESEND_API_KEY confirmed set)
- Capacity math accuracy (should be exactly 75 deducted)
- Logging verification (email_logs and activity_logs should populate)

**See:** `EMAIL_DEBUG_STATUS.md` for complete debugging documentation

## üìä Session 8 Summary - Email & Capacity Crisis

**Environment:** https://www.compsync.net (Production)
**Testing Method:** Incognito browser, fresh deploys, SQL verification
**Result:** 4 critical fixes, clean database, ready for testing

### Critical Fixes Deployed (Commit 68e421e)

**Fix #1: Email Notification Blocking (commit 86f21a4)**
- **Problem:** NO email_logs, NO activity_logs despite approvals working
- **Root Cause:** Uncaught error in capacity update killing function execution before email code
- **Solution:** Wrapped capacity update in try/catch block
- **Files:** reservation.ts:689-707
- **Impact:** Email and logging code now executes even if capacity update fails

**Fix #2: Double-Capacity Deduction (commit 967028c)**
- **Problem:** 75-space reservation deducted 150 spaces (298‚Üí448)
- **Evidence:** St. Cath #1 showing 318 extra spaces deducted (130 actual vs 448 shown)
- **Root Cause:** Re-approval of already-approved reservations deducting again
- **Solution:** Only decrement if existingReservation.status === 'pending'
- **Files:** reservation.ts:690-710
- **Impact:** Capacity deducted exactly once per reservation approval

**Fix #3: Entry Creation Schema Mismatch (commit 68e421e)**
- **Problem:** "column routine_number does not exist in the current database"
- **User Clarification:** "routine number is for a later function to do with scheduling"
- **Solution:** Added routine_number column to database via migration + restored to schema
- **Files:** prisma/schema.prisma:448, migration file
- **Impact:** Entry creation now works, scheduling feature preserved

**Fix #4: Schedule Builder Field Mapping (commit 4ff7d7b)**
- **Problem:** Trying to update competition_entries.routine_number which doesn't exist for that purpose
- **Solution:** Changed to competition_entries.entry_number (correct field)
- **Files:** scheduleBuilder.ts:279
- **Impact:** Schedule locking will work correctly when feature is used

### Database State Reset
- ‚úÖ Test database completely wiped
- ‚úÖ All competition capacities reset to 600/600
- ‚úÖ 4 competitions, 2 user profiles exist
- ‚úÖ 0 studios, 0 reservations (clean slate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Seed function broken (manual testing required)

### User Frustration Points
- Regression concerns: "honestly i'm very frsutrated at all the regression and tiny bugs"
- Schema sync fatigue: "We've literally already done a DB schema sync cleanup, but I guess we have to do it again"
- Context confusion: "WHO THE FUCK WAS TALKING ABOUT SCHEDULE LOCKING" (I was looking at wrong code)

## üöß Remaining Priority Issues

### Critical Priority - AWAITING VERIFICATION

1. **Email notification testing** (DEPLOYED - NOT TESTED)
   - Status: Fixes deployed (commit 68e421e)
   - Code changes: Try/catch wrapper + logging preserved
   - RESEND_API_KEY: Confirmed set by user
   - Testing needed: Create reservation ‚Üí approve ‚Üí verify email delivery
   - Verification: Check email_logs and activity_logs tables

2. **Capacity math verification** (DEPLOYED - NOT TESTED)
   - Status: Double-deduction fix deployed (commit 967028c)
   - Code change: Status check before decrement
   - Testing needed: Approve 75-space reservation
   - Expected: Competition capacity changes 600 ‚Üí 525 (exactly 75)
   - Verification: SQL query on competitions table

3. **Routine summary space refunding** (NEVER TESTED)
   - Status: Code exists (entry.ts:197-207)
   - User report: "I submitted a Summary for London with 12/100 spaces, spaces were not refunded"
   - Testing needed: Reserve 100 ‚Üí submit 75 ‚Üí verify 25 refunded
   - Impact: Studios lose unused reservation slots permanently

### High Priority

4. **Create comprehensive test data** (BLOCKER)
   - Status: 72% of tests blocked by missing data
   - Need: Studio with approved reservation + confirmed routines
   - Seed function: Broken, manual testing required
   - Impact: Cannot verify invoice generation, auto-close, CSV export

5. **Invoice detail page verification** (PARTIALLY RESOLVED)
   - Status: Root cause identified (data validation, not routing bug)
   - Need: Test data with confirmed routines

### Medium Priority

6. **Unified "Approve & Send Invoice" button** - One-click CD workflow
7. **Late fee CSV/PDF mismatch** - Appears in CSV, not PDF
8. **Invoice PDF layout audit** - Professional formatting

## üéØ Reservation Lifecycle (Complete Flow)

1. **SD creates reservation** ‚Üí Requests X spaces
2. **CD approves reservation** ‚Üí Confirms Y spaces (deducts tokens ONCE)
3. **SD creates routines** ‚Üí Builds up to Y routines (draft/registered)
4. **SD submits summary** ‚Üí Routines become 'confirmed'
   - If confirmed count Z < Y:
     - Refund (Y - Z) tokens to competition
     - Set `is_closed = true`
     - Reservation locked, SD must create new one
5. **CD generates invoice** ‚Üí Only confirmed routines included
6. **Invoice sent** ‚Üí Locked from editing (is_locked = true)
7. **Invoice marked PAID** ‚Üí Locked permanently

## üìà Next Session Priorities - VERIFICATION REQUIRED

### üéØ **IMMEDIATE - Testing Session Required**

**User must verify fixes work:**

1. **Test email delivery** (15 minutes)
   - Create SD account and studio
   - Create reservation for 75 spaces
   - Approve as CD
   - Verify email arrives
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM email_logs ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 1;`
   - Check database: `SELECT * FROM activity_logs WHERE action = 'reservation.approve' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;`

2. **Verify capacity math** (5 minutes)
   - Before approval: `SELECT available_reservation_tokens FROM competitions WHERE name = 'St. Cath #1';` (should be 600)
   - After approval: Should be 525 (exactly 75 deducted)
   - Not 450 (double-deduction bug would show this)

3. **Test routine space refunding** (20 minutes)
   - Approve reservation for 100 spaces (capacity: 600 ‚Üí 500)
   - Create 75 routines as SD
   - Submit routine summary
   - Verify capacity: 500 ‚Üí 525 (25 refunded)
   - Verify reservation.is_closed = true

### üöÄ **AFTER TESTING PASSES - Demo Prep Continues**

See `DEMO_PREP_PLAN.md` for complete Tuesday demo preparation plan
