# GlowDance Competition Portal - Project Status & Roadmap

**Last Updated**: September 25, 2025
**Project Phase**: MVP Demo Complete ‚Üí Production Development Ready

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

### **What We're Building**
The GlowDance Competition Portal is a **complete modernization** of an enterprise-grade dance competition management platform. This isn't just a simple registration system‚Äîit's a sophisticated **event production platform** that manages multi-day, multi-venue dance competitions with 387+ individual performances, elite championships, and professional production coordination.

### **Business Impact & Scale**
- **26+ dance studios** across multiple provinces/states (Canada & US)
- **387+ individual performances** in a single competition event
- **6-day multi-venue events** including competition halls, waterpark venues, and gala locations
- **Elite championship management** with specialized "Glow-Off" competitions and title rounds
- **Professional production coordination** including video, sound, backstage, and entertainment management
- **Revenue optimization** through VIP experiences and premium event coordination

### **Why This Rebuild is Critical**
The legacy system uses **dangerously outdated technologies**:
- jQuery 1.4.2 (2010) with severe security vulnerabilities
- XHTML 1.0 Transitional (deprecated)
- Blueprint CSS (obsolete)
- No mobile responsiveness
- Poor accessibility
- Significant technical debt
