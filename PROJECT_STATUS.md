- **Build Status:** ✅ Passing
- **Major Achievements:** Forgot password, Resend email integration, invoice lock for PAID status, parallel testing validation

---

## ✅ Completed Fixes (Total: 19)

### Session 1 (First Round):
1-13. [See CURRENT_WORK.md for detailed list]

### Session 2 (Invoice Security):
14. **Invoice lock after send** - Invoices automatically lock when status changes to SENT (invoice.ts:661, 881-883)
15. **Invoice confirmed routines only** - All invoice generation now filters to `status: 'confirmed'` entries (invoice.ts:140, 256, 509, 564)

### Session 3 (Reservation Auto-Close):
16. **Auto-close reservations with token refund** - Complete implementation (entry.ts:179-209)
    - Calculates unused spaces on summary submission
    - Sets `is_closed = true` when routines < approved spaces
    - Refunds unused tokens back to `competition.available_reservation_tokens`
    - Atomic transaction ensures data integrity
    - Prevents studios from reusing closed reservations (must create new one)

### Session 4 (Password Recovery & Email):
17. **Forgot password link** - Added "Forgot password?" link to login page (login/page.tsx:85-87)
18. **Email service switch to Resend** - Complete rewrite from nodemailer/SMTP to Resend API (email.ts:1-128)
    - Uses existing RESEND_API_KEY from environment
    - Email logging to database with success tracking
    - Better error handling and diagnostics

### Session 5 (Critical Bug Fixes):
19. **Invoice lock for PAID status** - Fixed invoices not locking when marked as PAID (invoice.ts:766)
    - Applied migration to lock all existing SENT/PAID invoices
    - Verified by parallel testing agent: All 3 PAID invoices now locked ✅

## 🚧 Remaining High Priority Issues

From EMPWR testing and parallel agent verification:

1. **Invoice detail page 400 error** - 🟡 PARTIALLY RESOLVED (CRITICAL)
   - Root cause identified: Data validation issue, not routing bug
   - Route structure correct: `/dashboard/invoices/[studioId]/[competitionId]`
   - Blocked: Requires test data (studio with confirmed routines)
   - Next: Create test scenario to verify fix

2. **Email notifications testing** - ⏭️ BLOCKED (HIGH)
   - Resend integration complete ✅
   - Blocked: No recent email activity to verify
   - Need: Trigger workflow actions to generate emails
   - Verify email_logs table populates correctly

3. **Late fee mismatch** - Appears in CSV export but not on PDF (MEDIUM)
   - Need to verify PDF generation includes late_fee field

4. **Unified "Approve & Send Invoice" button** - One-click CD workflow (MEDIUM)
   - Combine reservation approval + invoice generation + send email

5. **Invoice PDF branding** - Use competition.branding_logo and competition.name (LOW)
   - Update PDF template with tenant/competition branding

6. **Invoice PDF layout audit** - Fix fonts, alignment, spacing (LOW)
   - Professional invoice formatting improvements

## 🎯 Reservation Lifecycle (Complete Flow)

1. **SD creates reservation** → Requests X spaces
2. **CD approves reservation** → Confirms Y spaces (deducts from available_tokens)
3. **SD creates routines** → Builds up to Y routines (draft/registered)
4. **SD submits summary** → Routines become 'confirmed'
   - If confirmed count Z < Y:
     - Refund (Y - Z) tokens to competition
     - Set reservation.is_closed = true
     - Reservation locked, SD must create new one for more spaces
5. **CD generates invoice** → Only includes confirmed routines
6. **Invoice sent** → Locked from editing

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Create test data** - Enable full feature verification (CRITICAL)
   - Studio with approved reservation + confirmed routines
   - Test invoice detail page with valid data
   - Verify auto-close reservation workflow

2. **Email notification testing** - Trigger workflow actions (HIGH)
   - Submit reservation → verify email sent
   - Approve reservation → verify email sent
   - Submit summary → verify email sent
   - Send invoice → verify email sent

3. **Complete invoice 400 investigation** - Test with valid data (CRITICAL)
   - Verify invoice generation works with confirmed routines
   - Test locked invoice UI behavior
   - Confirm RLS policies working correctly

4. **Unified Approve & Send button** - Streamline CD workflow (MEDIUM)
5. **Invoice PDF improvements** - Branding + late fee + layout (MEDIUM)
6. **Security audit** - Run `supabase:get_advisors` for RLS/performance (LOW)
