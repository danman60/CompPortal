# CompPortal Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24 01:15 UTC

## Current Status: âœ… EMPWR Testing Round 2 - Session 3 Complete

### Latest Session (Oct 24, 2025) - Session 3

**Auto-Close Reservations with Token Refund**

**Session Summary:**
- **Duration:** ~30 minutes
- **Commits:** 2 successful (15a2527, 48edcf7)
- **Build Status:** âœ… Passing
- **Major Feature:** Complete reservation lifecycle management

---

## âœ… Completed Fixes (Total: 16)

### Session 1 (First Round):
1-13. [See CURRENT_WORK.md for detailed list]

### Session 2 (Invoice Security):
14. **Invoice lock after send** - Invoices automatically lock when status changes to SENT (invoice.ts:661, 881-883)
15. **Invoice confirmed routines only** - All invoice generation now filters to `status: 'confirmed'` entries (invoice.ts:140, 256, 509, 564)

### Session 3 (Reservation Auto-Close):
16. **Auto-close reservations with token refund** - Complete implementation (entry.ts:179-209)
    - Calculates unused spaces on summary submission
    - Sets `is_closed = true` when routines < approved spaces
    - Refunds unused tokens back to `competition.available_reservation_tokens`
    - Atomic transaction ensures data integrity
    - Prevents studios from reusing closed reservations (must create new one)

---

## ðŸš§ Remaining High Priority Issues

From EMPWR testing, still requiring implementation:

1. **Individual routine pricing display** - âœ… RESOLVED
   - User clarified: Current behavior is correct
   - Individual prices shown when clicking routines in summary
   - Total pricing shown in live summary footer

2. **Late fee mismatch** - Appears in CSV export but not on PDF
   - Need to verify PDF generation includes late_fee field

3. **Unified "Approve & Send Invoice" button** - One-click CD workflow
   - Combine reservation approval + invoice generation + send email

4. **Invoice PDF branding** - Use competition.branding_logo and competition.name
   - Update PDF template with tenant/competition branding

5. **Invoice PDF layout audit** - Fix fonts, alignment, spacing
   - Professional invoice formatting improvements

## ðŸ“Š Production Deployment

**Environment:** https://empwr.compsync.net
**Status:** Auto-deploying (commit 48edcf7)
**Latest Build:** âœ… Passing (all 59 routes)

**Critical Feature Note:** Auto-close reservation logic now prevents capacity hoarding. Studios must submit summaries matching their approved spaces or forfeit unused slots.

## ðŸ“ˆ Session 3 Metrics

- **Fixes Completed:** 1 major feature (auto-close + token refund)
- **Files Modified:** 1 (entry.ts)
- **Lines Changed:** +28 -10
- **Build Passes:** âœ… All 59 routes compiling

## ðŸŽ¯ Reservation Lifecycle (Complete Flow)

1. **SD creates reservation** â†’ Requests X spaces
2. **CD approves reservation** â†’ Confirms Y spaces (deducts from available_tokens)
3. **SD creates routines** â†’ Builds up to Y routines (draft/registered)
4. **SD submits summary** â†’ Routines become 'confirmed'
   - If confirmed count Z < Y:
     - Refund (Y - Z) tokens to competition
     - Set reservation.is_closed = true
     - Reservation locked, SD must create new one for more spaces
5. **CD generates invoice** â†’ Only includes confirmed routines
6. **Invoice sent** â†’ Locked from editing

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Unified Approve & Send button** - Streamline CD workflow (HIGH)
2. **Invoice PDF improvements** - Branding + late fee + layout (MEDIUM)
3. **Production testing** - Verify auto-close on empwr.compsync.net (HIGH)
4. **Security audit** - Run `supabase:get_advisors` for RLS/performance
5. **UX polish** - Navigation, session persistence, location display
