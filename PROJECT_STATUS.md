- ‚úÖ Routine creation with 7 category types
- ‚úÖ Dancer management (batch + individual)
- ‚úÖ Space limit enforcement (counter UI + backend validation)
- ‚úÖ "Create Routines" CTA on approved reservations
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (SD/CD)
- ‚úÖ Judge scoring interface with special awards
- ‚úÖ Score review tab for judges

### Known Gaps
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email notifications (deferred post-MVP)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Studio approval workflow (deferred post-MVP)

## Latest Session (Oct 4, 2025 - Space Limit Validation Testing)

### üî¥ CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED & FIXED

**Issue**: Space limit validation was being bypassed when `reservation_id` was undefined
**Root Cause**: Backend validation used `if (input.reservation_id)` which skipped entirely when undefined
**Impact**: Studios could create unlimited routines despite confirmed space limits

**Fix Applied** (`src/server/routers/entry.ts:327-365`):
- Now always checks for approved reservations using `findFirst`
- Requires `reservation_id` when approved reservation exists
- Validates `reservation_id` matches the approved reservation
- Enforces space limit before allowing entry creation

### ‚úÖ Validation Test Results

**Test**: Attempt to create 11th routine when 10-space limit reached
**Result**: ‚úÖ **VALIDATION WORKING CORRECTLY**
- Error message: "Reservation capacity exceeded. Confirmed: 10, Current: 10"
- Database verified: Still exactly 10 entries (11th was blocked)
- Space counter UI: Shows "10 / 10 - 0 spaces remaining"

**Files Modified**:
- `src/server/routers/entry.ts` - Backend validation fix

### Test Data Cleanup
- Fixed inconsistent test data (first 3 routines had `reservation_id: null`)
- All 10 routines now properly linked to reservation `07222fbe...`
- Ready for production testing

## Next Session Priorities

1. Deploy backend fix to production (Vercel auto-deploy)
2. Final QA pass on production environment
3. Record demo video/screenshots
4. Post-MVP: Consider adding UI warning when approaching space limit
