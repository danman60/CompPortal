- Tests passed: 5 (100% pass rate)
- Tests blocked: 18 (72% due to test data limitations)

**üìÑ Documentation Created:**

## üöß Remaining Priority Issues

### Critical Priority

1. **Create comprehensive test data** (BLOCKER)
   - Status: 72% of tests blocked by missing data
   - Need: Studio with approved reservation + confirmed routines
   - Impact: Cannot verify invoice generation, auto-close, CSV export
   - Action: Build automated seed script

2. **Email notification testing** (BLOCKED)
   - Status: Resend integration complete, no activity to verify
   - Need: Trigger workflow actions (submit, approve, send)
   - Impact: Cannot confirm email delivery in production
   - Action: Manual workflow testing after test data creation

### High Priority

3. **Invoice detail page verification** (PARTIALLY RESOLVED)
   - Status: Root cause identified (data validation, not routing bug)
   - Route structure correct: `[studioId]/[competitionId]`
   - Need: Test data with confirmed routines
   - Action: Verify with valid studio+competition combination

4. **Unified "Approve & Send Invoice" button** (MEDIUM)
   - One-click CD workflow
   - Combine: approval ‚Üí invoice generation ‚Üí email send

### Medium Priority

5. **Late fee CSV/PDF mismatch** - Appears in CSV, not PDF
6. **Invoice PDF branding** - Use competition logo/name
7. **Invoice PDF layout audit** - Professional formatting

## üéØ Reservation Lifecycle (Complete Flow)

1. **SD creates reservation** ‚Üí Requests X spaces
2. **CD approves reservation** ‚Üí Confirms Y spaces (deducts tokens)
3. **SD creates routines** ‚Üí Builds up to Y routines (draft/registered)
4. **SD submits summary** ‚Üí Routines become 'confirmed'
   - If confirmed count Z < Y:
     - Refund (Y - Z) tokens to competition
     - Set `is_closed = true`
     - Reservation locked, SD must create new one
5. **CD generates invoice** ‚Üí Only confirmed routines included
6. **Invoice sent** ‚Üí Locked from editing (is_locked = true)
7. **Invoice marked PAID** ‚Üí Locked permanently
