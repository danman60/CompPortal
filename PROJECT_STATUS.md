## Current Status: Parallel Rebuild - Refining Workflow (80%)

### Latest Work: Session 17 - Manual Testing Round + Entry Creation Planning

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Multiple critical bugs fixed, invoice flow perfected, entry rebuild planned

**SESSION 17 ACHIEVEMENTS:**

**Manual Testing Round (CD Flow):**
1. ✅ Tested reservation → approval → summary → invoice creation
2. ✅ Fixed 10x display bug in pipeline table (parseInt radix)
3. ✅ Fixed counter re-animation on alt-tab (useCountUp hasAnimated ref)
4. ✅ Fixed bottom bar capacity display (LiveSummaryBar)
5. ✅ Fixed create routine button navigation (context params)
6. ✅ Fixed UUID validation in summary submission (actual reservation fields)
7. ✅ Fixed invoice creation query (reservation-based, not status-based)
8. ✅ Added missing database statuses (invoiced, closed, adjusted)
9. ✅ Fixed invoice redirect after creation (studioId/competitionId)
10. ✅ Fixed generateForStudio 400 error (draft entries support)
11. ✅ Fixed SD invoice visibility (query actual invoices table)
12. ✅ Made invoice singular permanent DB object (not regenerated)
13. ✅ Fixed capacity counters re-animating on button clicks (React.memo)

**Entry Creation Analysis:**
- ✅ Analyzed current UnifiedRoutineForm (765 lines, 3-step wizard)
- ✅ Compared to business logic requirements
- ✅ Created comprehensive rebuild plan (ENTRY_REBUILD_PLAN.md)
- ✅ Designed streamlined single-page form
- ✅ Defined 4 save actions (Cancel, Save, Save & Another, Create Like This)
- ✅ Removed fee display at creation stage
- ✅ 8-hour implementation plan ready for next session

**Key Improvements This Session:**
- **Invoice as Singular DB Object:** Created once, stored permanently, never regenerated
- **Better Data Flow:** Pipeline creates → DB stores → Detail reads DB → One source of truth
- **Studio Director Access:** Invoices properly filtered by status (SENT/PAID only)
- **Capacity Counters:** No longer re-animate on state changes
- **Entry Creation Plan:** Clear path from 765-line wizard to clean single-page form

## 📊 Rebuild Progress: 80%

✅ **Phase 0:** Backend status progression (invoice.ts, reservation.ts)
✅ **Phase 1:** Shared UI components (6 components, 336 lines)
✅ **Phase 2:** Custom hooks (4 hooks, 297 lines)
✅ **Phase 3:** Entries page (8 components, 699 lines)
✅ **Phase 4:** Pipeline page (9 components, 870 lines)
✅ **Phase 5:** E2E testing (15/15 golden path tests passed)
✅ **Phase 6:** Dashboard REBUILD badges + manual testing fixes
⏳ **Phase 7:** Entry creation rebuild (8 hours planned)
⏳ **Phase 8:** Production cutover (awaiting completion)

## Invoice Flow Perfected

### **Problem:** Invoice data inconsistency
- Old flow regenerated invoice from entries every time
- Detail page showed different data than pipeline/list
- No permanent record in database

### **Solution:** Singular DB Object Pattern
1. **Pipeline:** "Create Invoice" → Writes to `invoices` table (status: DRAFT)
2. **Pipeline:** "Send Invoice" → Updates status to SENT → Visible to SD
3. **List Page:** Queries `invoices` table filtered by status
4. **Detail Page:** Reads from `invoices` table (primary source)
5. **Fallback:** `generateForStudio` only if no DB record exists (old invoices)

### **Key Changes:**
- `invoice.ts:56-141` - Transform `getByStudioAndCompetition` to return full invoice from DB
- `invoice.ts:248-296` - Rewrite `getByStudio` to query invoices table (not entries)
- `InvoiceDetail.tsx:25-483` - Use DB invoice as primary, generated as fallback
- `invoice.ts:135-141` - Support draft entries in `generateForStudio` query

### **Result:**
✅ One invoice per reservation
✅ Permanent in database
✅ Consistent across all views
✅ Studio Directors see SENT/PAID invoices only
✅ Competition Directors see all invoices

## Entry Creation Rebuild Plan

**Current State:** UnifiedRoutineForm (765 lines, 3-step wizard)

**Target State:** Streamlined single-page form

### Key Features:
1. **4 Save Actions:**
   - Cancel → Discard and return
   - Save → Create and return
   - Save & Create Another → Reset all fields
   - Create Another Like This → Keep dancers/auto-fields, clear details

2. **No Fee Display** - Fees calculated at summary submission only

3. **Reservation-First** - Always shows capacity (X/Y used, Z remaining)

4. **Auto-Calculations:**
   - Age group from average dancer age
   - Size category from dancer count
   - Manual override options

### Implementation Plan: 8 hours
- Session 1: Foundation (route, hook, container) - 2h
- Session 2: Form sections (details, dancers, auto-calc) - 3h
- Session 3: Integration (context bar, actions, mutations) - 2h
- Session 4: Polish (UX, edge cases, validation) - 1h

**Status:** Plan complete, ready for next session with auto-compact

- ✅ Architecture defined (7 components + 1 hook)
- ✅ Tasks broken down (2h + 3h + 2h + 1h)
- ✅ Success metrics defined

**Session 1 Tasks (2 hours):**
1. Create route: `/dashboard/entries-rebuild/create`
