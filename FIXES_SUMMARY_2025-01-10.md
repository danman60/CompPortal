# Critical Fixes Summary - 2025-01-10

## Session Results

### ✅ Fix 1: Dancer Creation Backend Error
**Commit**: a25ec1f
**Status**: VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION

**Problem**:
- Prisma error: `Argument 'studios' is missing`
- 0 dancers saved when submitting batch form
- Same relation syntax issue as routine creation

**Solution**:
- Fixed `batchCreate` mutation in `src/server/routers/dancer.ts:454-477`
- Use Prisma relation connect syntax for studios and tenants
- Fetch studio to get tenant_id before creating dancers

**Production Test**:
✅ Dancer "VERIFIED FIX" created successfully
✅ Success message: "Successfully created 1 dancer(s)!"
✅ Screenshot: `dancer-creation-verified.png`

### ✅ Fix 2: White-on-White Dropdown Styling
**Commit**: 167a02f
**Status**: VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION

**Problem**:
- Gender and skill level dropdowns had white text on white background
- Completely unreadable when opened
- User reported: "white on white in all dropdowns"

**Solution**:
- Changed dropdown background from `bg-white/5` to `bg-gray-800` (DancerBatchForm.tsx:233, 261)
- Added explicit `bg-gray-800 text-white` to all option elements
- Used Tailwind arbitrary variant `[&>option]:bg-gray-800 [&>option]:text-white`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/DancerBatchForm.tsx` (lines 231-240, 259-269)

**Production Test**:
✅ Gender dropdown: Select, Male, Female, Non-binary, Other (all readable)
✅ Skill level dropdown: Select, Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite (all readable)
✅ Dark gray background with white text - excellent contrast

### ✅ Fix 3: Table Headers Not Visible
**Commit**: 167a02f
**Status**: VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION

**Problem**:
- Table headers rendering but invisible
- Only checkbox column header visible
- User reported: "all table views are rendering incorrectly"
- Headers existed in DOM but not showing due to backdrop-blur transparency

**Solution**:
- Changed thead from `backdrop-blur-md` to solid `bg-gray-800` (EntriesList.tsx:780)
- Added `bg-gray-800` to all header cells for consistent background
- Removed transparent `bg-gray-800/90` in favor of solid `bg-gray-800`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/EntriesList.tsx` (lines 780-797)

**Production Test**:
✅ All column headers visible: Routine #, Title, Category, Age Group, Dancers, Music, Status, Actions
✅ Sortable arrows (⇅) showing on all sortable columns
✅ Checkbox column header functional
✅ Screenshot: `table-headers-fixed-verified.png`
