# BLOCKER: 48-Routine Save Limit (HTTP 500 at 49+)

**Date:** November 29, 2025
**Session:** Session 79 - Expanded Testing
**Severity:** P0 - CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Status:** 🔴 ACTIVE - Blocks Production Deployment
**Build:** v1.1.2 (4bd8870)
**Exact Threshold:** 48 routines maximum, fails at 49+

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 scheduler **FAILS** to save schedules with 49+ routines, returning HTTP 500 error. Threshold investigation confirmed **48 routines is the maximum** that can be saved successfully. Any attempt to save 49 or more routines results in HTTP 500 backend error. This blocks production deployment as real competitions commonly have 50-200 routines.

**Impact:** Production-blocking. System cannot handle realistic competition volumes.
**Critical Finding:** The limit (48) is very close to typical small competition sizes (50-60 routines).

---

## Reproduction Steps

**Test:** Stress test - Schedule all 50 routines on single day

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/director-panel/schedule` on tester.compsync.net
2. Execute "Reset All" to clear schedule (50 routines in unscheduled pool)
3. Select all 50 routines using "✓ Select All" button
4. Click Saturday, April 11 tab to set as active day
5. Drag first routine from unscheduled pool to Saturday schedule area
6. **Result:** ✅ All 50 routines successfully scheduled in UI
   - Entry numbers: #100 - #149 (sequential)
   - Times: 8:00 AM - 10:32 AM (2h 32min total)
   - Trophy badges, notes badges, conflict warnings all working
7. Click "💾 Save Schedule" button
8. **Result:** ❌ HTTP 500 error, toast: "Failed to save some days"

## Error Details

### Browser Console Errors
```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
  @ https://tester.compsync.net/api/trpc/scheduling.schedule?batch=1
```

### User-Facing Error
- Toast message: "Failed to save some days"
- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- tRPC endpoint: `/api/trpc/scheduling.schedule?batch=1`

### UI State After Error
- "Unsaved changes" indicator still showing
- Schedule still visible in UI (draft state)
- Save button still enabled (can retry)
- No data persisted to database

---

## Exact Threshold Identified

**Session 78 Testing Results:**
- ✅ 46 routines: Save successful (HTTP 200)
- ✅ Data persisted after refresh
- ✅ All functionality working

**Session 79 Threshold Investigation:**
- ✅ 47 routines: Save successful (HTTP 200)
- ✅ 48 routines: Save successful (HTTP 200) ← **MAXIMUM WORKING**
- ❌ 49 routines: Save failure (HTTP 500) ← **BREAKING POINT**
- ❌ 50 routines: Save failure (HTTP 500)

**Exact Threshold:** **48 routines maximum**
**Failure Point:** 49+ routines (HTTP 500)

**Confirmed:** UI scheduling works perfectly for all routine counts. Backend save operation fails at 49+ routines.

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### 1. Database Batch Size Limit
**Likelihood:** High
**Evidence:** Works with 46, fails with 50
**Investigation Needed:**
- Check Supabase batch insert limits
- Review `scheduling.schedule` mutation code
- Check for hardcoded batch size limits

### 2. Backend Timeout
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Evidence:** HTTP 500 suggests server error, not timeout (would be 504)
**Investigation Needed:**
- Check Vercel function timeout settings
- Review tRPC mutation execution time
- Check database query performance with 50 rows

### 3. Database Transaction Size Limit
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Evidence:** Saving 50 routines likely involves large transaction
**Investigation Needed:**
- Check PostgreSQL transaction size limits
- Review transaction structure in save mutation
- Check if mutation uses single transaction or batches

### 4. Validation Error
**Likelihood:** Low
**Evidence:** UI validation passed, would expect HTTP 400 not 500
**Investigation Needed:**
- Check backend validation logic
- Review entry number uniqueness constraints
- Check for data type mismatches

### 5. Memory/Resource Exhaustion
**Likelihood:** Low
**Evidence:** Would expect timeout or different error code
**Investigation Needed:**
- Check Vercel function memory limits
- Review mutation memory usage
- Check for memory leaks in save operation

## Impact Assessment

### Production Impact: EXTREME - SYSTEM UNUSABLE

**CRITICAL:** User reports production requirement of **1000+ routines**.

**Current Capability vs. Production Needs:**
- **Maximum working:** 48 routines ✅
- **Production requirement:** 1000 routines ❌
- **Capacity shortfall:** ~2000% (48 vs 1000)

**Realistic Competition Volumes:**
- Small competition: 30-60 routines ❌ (partially blocked at 49+)
- Medium competition: 60-120 routines ❌ (completely blocked)
- Large competition: 120-200 routines ❌ (completely blocked)
- **Production requirement: 1000+ routines** ❌ (CATASTROPHICALLY BLOCKED)

**User Experience:**
- Competition Directors schedule all routines in UI ✅
- Save operation fails silently ❌
- No clear error message explaining limit ❌
- Data loss potential (unsaved work) ❌

**Deployment Risk:**
- **CANNOT DEPLOY** to production with this limitation
- Users will lose hours of scheduling work
- No workaround available (cannot split into multiple saves per day)
- Reputational damage if deployed and fails

## Recommended Investigation Steps

**Priority 1: Find Exact Threshold (30 min)**
1. Test with 47, 48, 49 routines to find breaking point
2. Document exact number where failure occurs
3. Check if threshold is consistent across days

**Priority 2: Backend Code Review (1 hour)**
1. Read `scheduling.schedule` tRPC mutation code
2. Check for batch size limits, loops, or hardcoded values
3. Review database query structure
4. Check transaction size and structure

**Priority 3: Database Investigation (30 min)**
1. Check Supabase/PostgreSQL batch insert limits
2. Review `competition_routines` table constraints
3. Check for triggers or hooks that run on insert/update
4. Verify no row limits or transaction size limits

**Priority 4: Server Logs Analysis (if accessible)**
1. Check Vercel runtime logs for error details
2. Check Supabase logs for database errors
3. Look for stack trace or specific error message

## Potential Fixes (Pending Investigation)

### Option 1: Increase Backend Batch Size Limit
**If:** Hardcoded limit found in code
**Action:** Increase limit to 200+ routines
**Risk:** Low if properly tested
**Effort:** 1-2 hours

### Option 2: Implement Batch Processing
**If:** Database/transaction size limit
**Action:** Split save into batches of N routines
**Risk:** Medium (must maintain atomicity)
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

### Option 3: Optimize Query Structure
**If:** Performance/timeout issue
**Action:** Optimize database queries, use bulk operations
**Risk:** Low
**Effort:** 2-4 hours

### Option 4: Increase Infrastructure Limits
**If:** Vercel function timeout/memory limit
**Action:** Increase function timeout, memory allocation
**Risk:** Low (cost increase)
**Effort:** 1 hour

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Session 79):**
1. ✅ Document blocker with evidence
2. ⏳ Find exact threshold (47, 48, or 49 routines)
3. ⏳ Attempt save with fewer routines to verify threshold
4. ⏳ Update BLOCKER with exact breaking point

**Investigation Required:**
1. Code review: `scheduling.schedule` mutation
2. Database review: constraints, limits, triggers
3. Infrastructure review: Vercel function limits
4. Log review: Find exact error message from server

**Cannot Proceed Until:**
- Exact threshold identified
- Root cause determined
- Fix implemented and tested
- Verified with 100+ routines (realistic volume)

---

## Testing Status

**Completed:**
- [x] Test 1: Schedule 50 routines in UI ✅ PASSED
- [x] Test 2: Save 50-routine schedule ❌ FAILED (HTTP 500)

**Blocked:**
- [ ] Test 2 continuation: Verify persistence (cannot save)
- [ ] Test 3-7: All remaining expanded tests (blocked by save failure)

**Can Still Test:**
- UI functionality with 50 routines (working perfectly)
- Conflict detection (2 conflicts found correctly)
- Trophy helper system (working correctly)
- Entry numbering (sequential #100-#149)
- Time cascade (2h 32min total, correct)

## Conclusion

**Status:** 🔴 **EXTREME PRODUCTION BLOCKER - SYSTEM UNUSABLE FOR PRODUCTION**

Phase 2 scheduler UI works perfectly but backend save operation has a **hard limit of 48 routines**. This is a catastrophic blocker for production deployment:

**Critical Facts:**
- **Production requirement:** 1000+ routines (user confirmed)
- **Current maximum:** 48 routines
- **Gap:** System can handle only 4.8% of production needs
- **Failure mode:** Silent HTTP 500 error at 49+ routines
- **User impact:** All scheduling work lost above 48 routines

**Severity Justification:**
- This is not a minor limitation - it's a 2000% capacity shortfall
- Users would lose hours of work when hitting the invisible 48-routine limit
- No clear error message explaining the limit
- No workaround available (cannot split into multiple saves per day)

**Recommendation:**
1. **DO NOT DEPLOY** to production under any circumstances
2. **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Investigate backend code for batch size limits, transaction limits, or query parameter limits
3. **Target fix:** Must support 1000+ routines minimum
4. **Verify fix:** Test with 1500+ routines to ensure headroom
