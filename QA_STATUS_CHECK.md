**Location:** My Dancers → Edit Dancer

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (Commit 167a02f)

### ⏭️ 3. Create Reservation - No Competitions - PENDING
**Location:** My Reservations → Create Reservation
**Issue:** Dropdown lists only "Select a competition" with no actual competitions
**Severity:** High
**Status:** ⏭️ **NOT STARTED**

**Impact:** Reservation workflow completely unusable - users cannot book competitions

**Required Fix:**
- Investigate competition fetching logic in reservation creation flow
- Check if competitions query is filtering incorrectly
- Ensure all available competitions are loaded for the studio
- Test that competitions appear in dropdown

---

### ⏭️ 4. Profile Settings - Email Notifications - PENDING
**Location:** Dashboard → Settings → Profile
**Issue:** Toggling email notifications doesn't persist; switch resets to on
**Severity:** High
**Status:** ⏭️ **NOT STARTED**

**Impact:** User preferences not saved - reduces trust in settings

**Required Fix:**
- Fix update logic for notification preferences
- Add toast notification confirming save
- Verify mutation persists to database
- Check if form state resets incorrectly

---

### ⏭️ 5. Quick Actions Drag Hint - PENDING
**Location:** Dashboard
**Issue:** "Drag cards to reorder" tooltip but dragging does nothing
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** ⏭️ **NOT STARTED**

**Impact:** Misleading UI - suggests functionality that doesn't exist

**Required Fix:**
- Either: Implement drag-and-drop sorting (complex)
- Or: Remove the misleading hint (quick fix)
- **Recommendation:** Remove hint for now, implement drag later

---

### ⏭️ 6. Duplicate Dropdown Entries - PENDING
**Location:** Routine creation/editing forms
**Issue:** Age group and routine size dropdowns have duplicate entries (Solo, Duo/Trio repeated)
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** ⏭️ **NOT STARTED**

**Impact:** Confuses users during routine creation

**Required Fix:**
- Investigate age group and routine size data sources
- Clean up duplicate enum values
- Use Set or unique filter when populating dropdowns
- Verify in production that each option appears once

---

### ⏭️ 7. Truncated Labels in Forms - PENDING
**Location:** Various forms
**Issue:** "Non-b" instead of "Non-binary", "Intern" instead of "Intermediate"
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** ⏭️ **NOT STARTED**

**Note:** Gender and skill level dropdowns in dancer creation are NOW fixed (Issue #2)

**Remaining Areas to Check:**
- Routine creation/edit forms
- Other form dropdowns throughout portal
- May be partially resolved by Issue #2 fix

**Required Fix:**
- Increase select box width
- Allow text wrapping if needed
- Test all forms for truncation

---

### ⏭️ 8. Missing Success/Error Feedback - PENDING
**Location:** All forms
**Issue:** Saves return silently - users uncertain if action succeeded
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** ⏭️ **NOT STARTED**

**Impact:** Low confidence - users don't know if their actions worked

**Required Fix:**
- Implement toast notifications system (react-hot-toast already installed)
- Add success toasts to all create/update/delete mutations
- Add error toasts with helpful messages
- Test across: dancers, routines, settings, music uploads, reservations

**Files to Update:**
- All tRPC mutation onSuccess/onError handlers
- Consider creating reusable toast helper function

---
