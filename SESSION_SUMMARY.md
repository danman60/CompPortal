# Session Summary - 2025-01-10

## Critical Fix: Dancer Creation

**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Commit**: a25ec1f
**Priority**: CRITICAL (demo blocker)

### Problem
QA Report identified dancer creation completely broken:
- Error: `Invalid prisma.dancers.create() invocation - Argument 'studios' is missing`
- 0 dancers saved when submitting form
- Same Prisma relation syntax issue as routine creation

### Solution
Fixed `batchCreate` mutation in `src/server/routers/dancer.ts`:
- Fetch studio to get tenant_id (lines 454-462)
- Use `studios: { connect: { id: input.studio_id } }` instead of `studio_id: input.studio_id`
- Use `tenants: { connect: { id: studio.tenant_id } }` instead of `tenant_id: ctx.tenantId`

### Verification
✅ Production tested at empwr.compsync.net
✅ Dancer "VERIFIED FIX" created successfully
✅ Success message displayed
✅ Screenshot captured

### Gender Dropdown Investigation
User reported gender dropdown missing options - **NOT A BUG**:
- Dropdown correctly shows: Male, Female, Non-binary, Other
- Same for skill level: Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite
- Issue was likely confusion from QA testing on wrong account type

### Known Issue Discovered
Dancers list page has React hydration error (minified #419/#310) after creating dancer:
- Occurs when redirecting to `/dashboard/dancers` after creation
- Does not prevent dancer creation from working
- Requires separate investigation

## Next Priority: Table Header Visibility
From previous session - table headers not visible on entries page load.
