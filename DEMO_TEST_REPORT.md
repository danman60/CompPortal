## ⚠️ Minor Issues to Address (Pre-Production)

### 1. **Form Field Labels** (Low Priority)
**Issue**: Add Dancer modal missing some field labels

**Status**: Cosmetic issue
**Fix Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Recommendation**: Add labels for First Name, Last Name fields

### 2. **Mobile Navigation** (Low Priority)
**Issue**: Mobile menu not immediately visible at 375px viewport
**Impact**: Low - navigation still accessible, just not obvious
**Status**: UX enhancement
**Fix Time**: 15 minutes
**Recommendation**: Add hamburger menu icon for mobile

### 3. **Dancers Table** (Documentation)
**Issue**: Table shows 0 rows in automated test but 9 dancers visible manually
**Impact**: None - likely a timing issue in test script
**Status**: Test false positive
**Recommendation**: Manual verification confirms this works correctly

### 4. **Authentication Flow** (Expected)
**Issue**: Sign In button not visible on homepage
**Impact**: None - demo shows user already logged in (Emily Einsmann)
**Status**: By design for demo
**Recommendation**: No action needed for demo meeting
