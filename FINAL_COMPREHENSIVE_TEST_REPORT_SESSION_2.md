## Bug Status After Session 2

### ✅ Bug #4: Date String Prisma Error - FIXED & VERIFIED
**Original Issue:** Date strings passed to Prisma without Date() wrapper
**Fix Applied:** `dancer.ts:577` - Wrap date in `new Date()`
**Verification:** 3 tests confirm fix working
- Test 1.1: 5/5 dancers imported with dates ✅
- Test 1.2: 5/5 dancers imported with dates ✅
- Test 2.1: 1 dancer created with date ✅

**Status:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED

---

### ✅ Bug #5: Competition.getAll 500 Error - FIXED & VERIFIED
**Original Issue:** Query referenced non-existent `deleted_at` column
**Fix Applied:** `competition.ts:84` - Removed `where.deleted_at = null`
**Verification:** 1 test confirms fix working
- Test 3.1: Competition dropdown loads 3 competitions ✅

**Status:** ✅ FULLY RESOLVED

---

### ⚠️ Bug #1: Date Timezone Offset - CONFIRMED (P1)
**Issue:** Dates displayed 1 day earlier than CSV/manual input
**Status:** STILL EXISTS after Bug #4 fix
**Severity:** P1 (High Priority - Recommended Pre-Launch Fix)

**Evidence from 11 Dancers Total:**

| Dancer Name | Input Date | UI Display | Offset |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Emma Johnson | 2010-05-**15** | May **14**, 2010 | -1 day |
| Michael Smith | 2008-03-**22** | Mar **21**, 2008 | -1 day |
| Sophia Williams | 2011-11-**08** | Nov **7**, 2011 | -1 day |
| James Brown | 2011-07-**08** | Jul **7**, 2011 | -1 day |
| Olivia Davis | 2009-12-**25** | Dec **24**, 2009 | -1 day |
| Sarah Test | 2013-06-**20** | Jun **19**, 2013 | -1 day |
| (5 more from Test 1.2) | Various | All -1 day | -1 day |

**Pattern:** 100% consistent -1 day offset across CSV import AND manual entry

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// Current code in dancer.ts:577
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00') : undefined,
// Missing 'Z' suffix causes local timezone interpretation
// Database stores UTC, UI displays local timezone → -1 day shift
```

**Required Fix (1 line):**
```typescript
// Add 'Z' to force UTC interpretation:
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00Z') : undefined,
```

**Data Migration Required:**
```sql
-- Correct existing birthdates (add 1 day to all 17 dancers)
UPDATE dancers
SET date_of_birth = date_of_birth + INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL
  AND tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
```

**Business Impact:**
- Age calculations off by 1 day (could affect eligibility)
- User confusion about incorrect birthdates
- Potential competition rule violations

**Recommendation:** Fix before launch OR within 24 hours of launch

---

### ❓ Bug #2: 4/5 Success Rate - CANNOT VERIFY
**Status:** Not reproduced in Session 2
**Tests Executed:** All imports showed 100% success (5/5, 5/5, 1/1)
**Hypothesis:** May only occur with larger datasets (50+ dancers)

**Recommendation:** Monitor production imports for partial failures

---

### ✅ Bug #3: Vague Error Messages - NOT APPLICABLE
**Status:** Not observed in Session 2
**Finding:** All error messages were detailed and specific
**Example:** Prisma errors showed exact field and validation issue

---

## New Findings from Session 2

### Finding #1: Capacity Validation - NO BLOCKING
**Test 3.2 Result:** System accepted 500 routine reservation without validation
**Expected:** Some limit or warning for excessive requests
**Actual:** Reservation created successfully, status=pending

**Implications:**
- Studios can request unlimited routines
- CD must manually review/adjust capacity
- No client-side validation preventing unreasonable requests

**Risk Level:** LOW (CD approval required, can adjust during approval)

**Recommendation:** Consider adding soft warning for >100 routines

---

### Finding #2: Multiple Reservations Allowed
**Test 3.3 Result:** Studio can submit multiple reservations for same competition
**Actual Behavior:** 2 reservations created for "St. Catharines #1" (5 and 500 routines)

**Implications:**
- Studios can submit incremental requests
- Studios can hedge capacity needs
- CD must manage multiple pending requests per studio

**Risk Level:** LOW (appears to be intentional design)

**Business Logic:** Likely allows studios to add more routines as they finalize numbers

---

### Finding #3: Status Filter Working Correctly
**Test 3.8 Result:** "Pending" filter button correctly shows only pending reservations
**UI Behavior:** Button highlights when active, shows count badge (3)

**Recommendation:** Competition dropdown filter not fully tested (visual dropdown not visible in automation)

---

## Database State After Session 2

### Dancers Created: 17 Total
**Previous Session (6 dancers):**
- Alice Cooper, Bob Dylan, Charlie Parker, Diana Ross, Eve Martinez
- 1 manual test dancer (no date)

**Session 2 (11 dancers with dates):**
- Test 1.1: Emma Johnson, Michael Smith, Sophia Williams, James Brown, Olivia Davis
- Test 1.2: 5 additional dancers (names not captured)
- Test 2.1: Sarah Test

**Key Observation:** ALL 11 dancers with dates show -1 day offset (Bug #1)

---

### Reservations Created: 3 Total
1. **EMPWR Dance - St. Catharines #2 2026**
   - Routines Requested: 10
   - Status: Pending
   - Date: Oct 29, 2025
   - Test: 3.1

2. **EMPWR Dance - St. Catharines #1 2026** (First)
   - Routines Requested: 500
   - Status: Pending
   - Date: Oct 29, 2025
   - Test: 3.2

3. **EMPWR Dance - St. Catharines #1 2026** (Second)
   - Routines Requested: 5
   - Status: Pending
   - Date: Oct 29, 2025
   - Test: 3.3

**Multi-Tenant Isolation:** ✅ Verified (all data scoped to EMPWR tenant)

---

### Entries Created: 0
**Reason:** No approved reservations (requires CD role)
**Verification:** Test 4.1 correctly blocked with message:
> "No approved reservations. Please request a reservation first."

**Business Logic:** ✅ Working as expected per Phase 1 spec

---

## Console Errors Analysis

**Total Console Errors:** 0
**Critical Errors:** 0
**Warnings:** 0
**API Failures:** 0

**All tests executed without JavaScript errors or API failures.**

✅ Manual dancer entry with dates
✅ Edit dancer information
✅ Create reservation workflow (full 4-step process)
✅ Capacity handling (large requests)
✅ Multiple reservations per competition
✅ Status filtering
✅ Multi-tenant data isolation

### Untested Functionality (80%)

**Category 1: CSV Import (7/10 remaining)**
- 🔴 Mixed date formats
- 🔴 Special characters in names
- 🔴 Duplicate detection
- 🔴 Invalid data validation
- 🔴 Extra columns handling
- 🔴 Mixed case headers
- 🔴 Large file performance (50+ dancers)

**Category 2: Manual Entry (3/5 remaining)**
- 🔴 Add dancer without date
- 🔴 Duplicate detection
- 🔴 Delete dancer

**Category 3: Reservation Flow (4/8 remaining)**
- 🔴 Edit pending reservation
- 🔴 Cancel reservation
- 🔴 View reservation details
- 🔴 Filter by competition

**Category 4: Entry Creation (10/10 untested)**
- 🔴 All entry creation tests require approved reservation
- 🔴 Cannot test as Studio Director role

**Category 5: Summary & Invoice (7/7 untested)**
- 🔴 All tests require CD role for approval workflow

**Category 6: Edge Cases (5/5 untested)**
- 🔴 Boundary conditions not tested

---

## Architectural Limitations

### Role-Based Testing Constraints
**Current Role:** Studio Director
**Limitations:**
- Cannot approve own reservations

- Cannot test CD approval/adjustment flow

**Impact on Coverage:**
- Categories 4-5 untestable without CD role (17/45 tests = 38%)
- Full end-to-end workflow cannot be verified

**Recommendation for Future Testing:**
1. Set up CD account for EMPWR tenant
2. Approve Session 2 reservations
3. Test entry creation workflow (Category 4)
4. Test summary workflow (Category 5)
