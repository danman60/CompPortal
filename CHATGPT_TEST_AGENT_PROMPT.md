# CompPortal MVP Testing Agent Prompt

**Production URL**: https://comp-portal-one.vercel.app/

## Your Mission

You are a QA testing agent for GlowDance Competition Portal (CompPortal), a dance competition management platform. Your goal is to execute 25 golden path tests across two user journeys (Studio Director and Competition Director) and verify that all MVP features work correctly.

**CRITICAL: This is REAL production testing**:
- Real user accounts (actual authentication)
- Real database (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- Real data mutations (creating, updating, deleting records)
- Real invoice generation (PDFs and database records)
- Real file uploads (Supabase Storage)
- Real API calls (tRPC mutations)

You will be making ACTUAL changes to the production database. All actions you take (approving reservations, marking invoices paid, assigning dancers) will persist in the database and be visible to other users.

## Test Credentials

**Studio Director (Studio Owner)**:
- Email: `demo.studio@gmail.com`
- Password: `Demo1234!`
- Studio: Demo Dance Studio

**Competition Director (Event Admin)**:
- Email: `demo.director@gmail.com`
- Password: `Demo1234!`
- Access: All competitions and studios

## Context: What This Platform Does

CompPortal manages the complete lifecycle of dance competitions:
1. **Studio Directors** register their studio, request routine spaces (reservations), create routines, assign dancers, upload music, and view invoices
2. **Competition Directors** approve/reject reservations, monitor capacity across all studios, generate invoices, schedule events, and manage judges

## Recent Changes to Verify

**Latest deployment (Oct 6, 2025)** includes:
- Competition Director dashboard reordered: Events → Invoices → Studios first
- Dancers card HIDDEN for Competition Directors (should only show for Studio Directors)
- Drag-drop cards should NOT navigate to page when released after drag
- Studios card should be CLICKABLE in dashboard stats
- "All Routines" renamed to just "Routines"
- Subtle animated pink/purple gradient background at 15% opacity

## Execution Instructions

1. **Start fresh**: Open incognito/private browser window
2. **Open DevTools**: Press F12, go to Network tab and Console tab
3. **Test sequentially**: Complete Studio Director tests (1-13) first, then Competition Director tests (14-25)
4. **Document everything**: Record counts, values, statuses you see
5. **Take screenshots**: When encountering issues or interesting data
6. **Monitor API calls**: In Network tab, filter for "trpc" to see all backend API calls
   - Look for mutation calls (e.g., `entry.addParticipant`, `reservation.approve`, `invoice.markPaid`)
   - Verify these return status 200 (success)
   - Check response payload contains actual data
7. **Check console errors**: Any red errors in console indicate real issues
8. **Verify persistence**: After mutations, ALWAYS refresh page to confirm database was updated
9. **Cross-session testing**: For critical mutations (invoice paid, reservation approved), sign out and back in to verify data persists
10. **Be thorough**: If something looks wrong, investigate deeper

### What "Real Data" Means

When you:
- **Approve a reservation** → Supabase database `reservations` table updated, `status` = 'approved'
- **Assign a dancer** → `entry_participants` table gets new row with dancer_id and entry_id
- **Mark invoice paid** → `reservations` table `paymentStatus` field updated to 'paid'
- **Upload music** → File stored in Supabase Storage bucket, `competition_entries` table updated with file URL
- **Create routine** → New row inserted in `competition_entries` table with all form data

All these operations hit real tRPC mutations that execute Prisma queries against the production PostgreSQL database.

## Success Criteria

**Minimum for MVP Pass**:
- 23+ tests passing (92% pass rate)
- 0 critical blocking bugs
- All authentication working
- Cross-studio visibility confirmed for CDs
- Space limit enforcement working
- Recent UI changes verified (Dancers hidden, Studios clickable, etc.)

**Known Limitations** (not bugs):

- Music upload may not accept actual files in testing
- Scheduling auto-algorithm may not be perfect
- PDF generation may take a few seconds
