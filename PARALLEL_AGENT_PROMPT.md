### STOP at Category 3/4 Boundary
Don't test Category 3 or below - Agent A is handling those.

## Test Execution Protocol

1. **Load Test Suite:**
```
Read D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal\E2E_TEST_SUITE.md
```

2. **Use Playwright MCP for all testing:**
```
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate to https://empwr.compsync.net
Login with credentials
Navigate to test pages
Take screenshots
Check console errors
```

3. **For EACH test:**
- Navigate to the feature
- Execute test steps
- Take screenshot (name: `test_X.X_RESULT_description.png`)
- Check console: `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages`
- Document pass/fail

4. **Known Bugs to Watch:**
- Bug #1 (P1): Dates show -1 day offset (2010-05-15 ‚Üí May 14, 2010)
- Bug #4 (P0): FIXED - Don't expect date Prisma errors
- Bug #5 (P0): FIXED - Competition API works

- ‚úÖ Category 4 attempted (10/10 tests, document what's blocked)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive report with screenshots
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation of architectural blockers
- ‚úÖ Professional handoff for CD-role testing

## Starting Commands

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal

# 2. Load test suite
Read E2E_TEST_SUITE.md

# 3. Start browser testing
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate https://empwr.compsync.net

# 4. Login
# Email: danieljohnabrahamson@gmail.com
# Password: 123456

# 5. Start with Category 6 tests
```

## Timeline Estimate
- Category 6: 15-20 minutes (thorough edge case testing)
- Category 5: 10-15 minutes (mostly documenting blocks)
- Category 4: 10-15 minutes (mostly documenting blocks)
- Report writing: 10 minutes
- **Total:** 45-60 minutes

## Critical Reminders
1. **Work BACKWARDS** - Start with Category 6, end at Category 4
2. **Don't duplicate** Agent A's work (Categories 1-3)
3. **Document blockers professionally** - this informs product decisions
4. **Take screenshots for EVERYTHING** - proof of what you tested
5. **Be thorough with edge cases** - Category 6 is often neglected
6. **Attempt blocked tests anyway** - document the blocking behavior
7. **Check console errors** after every test
8. **Update report progressively** - don't wait until the end

## Handoff Signal
When you complete Category 4, create a file:
```
D:\ClaudeCode\CompPortal\AGENT_B_COMPLETE.txt
```

With content:
```
Agent B testing complete.
- Category 6: X/5 passed
- Category 5: X/7 attempted (Y blocked)
- Category 4: X/10 attempted (Y blocked)
- Report: BACKWARD_TESTING_REPORT.md
- Ready for Agent A to review and merge results
```

**BEGIN TESTING NOW - START WITH CATEGORY 6 EDGE CASES**

Good luck, Agent B!
