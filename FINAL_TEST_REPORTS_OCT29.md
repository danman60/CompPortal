**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED in build 1528734

**Fix Applied:** `src/server/routers/competition.ts:84`
```typescript
// Removed line: where.deleted_at = null;
```

**Verification Test:**
- ‚úÖ Test 3.1: Reservation creation - PASS (3 competitions loaded)

**Impact:** Reservation workflow now fully functional

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Bug #1: Date Timezone Offset - CONFIRMED (P1)
**Severity:** P1 (High Priority - Pre-Launch)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è EXISTS in build 1528734

**Issue:** All dates displayed 1 day earlier than CSV/form input
**Pattern:** 100% consistent across all 12 dancers tested

**Evidence Table:**

| Dancer | Input Date | UI Display | Offset | Test |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|------|
| Emma Johnson | 2010-05-**15** | May **14**, 2010 | -1 day | 1.1 |
| Michael Smith | 2008-03-**22** | Mar **21**, 2008 | -1 day | 1.1 |
| Sophia Williams | 2011-11-**08** | Nov **7**, 2011 | -1 day | 1.1 |
| James Brown | 2011-07-**08** | Jul **7**, 2011 | -1 day | 1.1 |
| Olivia Davis | 2009-12-**25** | Dec **24**, 2009 | -1 day | 1.1 |
| Ava Martinez | 2010-06-**12** | Jun **11**, 2010 | -1 day | 1.2 |
| Ethan Garcia | 2009-04-**18** | Apr **17**, 2009 | -1 day | 1.2 |
| Isabella Rodriguez | 2011-09-**22** | Sep **21**, 2011 | -1 day | 1.2 |
| Noah Wilson | 2008-05-**30** | May **29**, 2008 | -1 day | 1.2 |
| Mia Anderson | 2008-10-**14** | Oct **13**, 2008 | -1 day | 1.2 |
| ManualTest WithDate | 2013-06-**20** | Jun **19**, 2013 | -1 day | 2.1 |

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```typescript
// Current (CAUSES BUG):
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00') : undefined,

// Missing 'Z' suffix causes:
// 1. Input: "2010-05-15" (no timezone)
// 2. new Date("2010-05-15T00:00:00") ‚Üí interpreted as local time (e.g., EDT)
// 3. Database stores in UTC ‚Üí shifts by timezone offset (-4h for EDT)
// 4. Result: 2010-05-14T20:00:00Z stored
// 5. UI displays: May 14, 2010 (1 day early)
```

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// OPTION 1: Force UTC (Recommended)
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00Z') : undefined,
// Add 'Z' suffix to force UTC interpretation

// OPTION 2: Use date string without time
// Keep as date-only string, adjust Prisma type handling
```

**Data Migration Required:**
```sql
-- Correct 17 existing dancers (add 1 day)
UPDATE dancers
SET date_of_birth = date_of_birth + INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL
  AND tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
  AND studio_id = 'de74304a-c0b3-4a5b-85d3-80c4d4c7073a';
```

**Business Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Age calculations off by 1 day
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Age group eligibility potentially incorrect
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User confusion about incorrect birthdates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Competition eligibility edge cases

**Recommendation:** Fix before launch (P1 priority)

---

### ‚ùì Bug #2: Race Condition 4/5 Success - UNKNOWN
**Severity:** P0 (Potential Launch Blocker)
**Status:** ‚ùì NOT TESTED

**Reason:** Requires larger CSV imports (50+ dancers) to reproduce
**Tests Needed:** Import 50+ dancer CSV multiple times

**Cannot Verify:** Current testing limited to small files (5-10 dancers)

---

### ‚úÖ Bug #3: Vague Error Messages - N/A
**Severity:** P2 (Low Priority)
**Status:** ‚úÖ NOT APPLICABLE

**Finding:** All errors encountered during testing were detailed and specific

**Original Issue:** Date strings passed to Prisma without conversion to Date objects
**Fix Applied:** `dancer.ts:577` - Wrap date string in `new Date()`
**Verification Test:** Test 1.1 - CSV import with dates

**Result:** ‚úÖ **PASS**
- File: `01-perfect-match.csv`
- Expected: 5 dancers with dates
- Actual: 5 dancers imported successfully
- Evidence: All dancers visible in UI with dates displayed

**Dancers Imported:**
1. Emma Johnson (May 14, 2010 - 15 years old)
2. Michael Smith (Mar 21, 2008 - 17 years old)
3. Sophia Williams (Nov 7, 2011 - 14 years old)
4. James Brown (Jul 7, 2011 - 14 years old)
5. Olivia Davis (Dec 24, 2009 - 16 years old)

**Impact:** CSV import now works with dates. Manual entry will also work (same code path).

---

### ‚úÖ Bug #5: Competition.getAll 500 Error - FIXED
**Original Issue:** Query referenced non-existent `deleted_at` column
**Fix Applied:** `competition.ts:84` - Removed line `where.deleted_at = null`
**Verification Test:** Test 3.1 - Create reservation

**Result:** ‚úÖ **PASS**
- Navigation: `/dashboard/reservations/new`
- Expected: Competition dropdown loads
- Actual: 3 competitions loaded successfully
- Reservation: Created successfully (10 routines, pending approval)

**Competitions Loaded:**
- EMPWR Dance - St. Catharines #2 2026
- EMPWR Dance - St. Catharines #1 2026
- EMPWR Dance - London 2026

**Reservation Created:**
- Competition: EMPWR Dance - St. Catharines #2
- Status: Pending
- Routines Requested: 10
- Consents: ‚úì Age of Consent, ‚úì Waiver Signed
- Date: Oct 29, 2025

**Impact:** Reservation workflow now functional. Studios can create reservations.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Bug #1: Date Timezone Offset - CONFIRMED (P1)
**Issue:** Dates displayed off by 1 day from CSV input
**Status:** STILL EXISTS after Bug #4 fix
**Severity:** P1 (High Priority - Pre-Launch)

**Evidence:**
| Dancer | CSV Date | UI Display | Offset |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| Emma Johnson | 2010-05-**15** | May **14**, 2010 | -1 day |
| Michael Smith | 2008-03-**22** | Mar **21**, 2008 | -1 day |
| Sophia Williams | 2011-11-**08** | Nov **7**, 2011 | -1 day |
| James Brown | 2011-07-**08** | Jul **7**, 2011 | -1 day |
| Olivia Davis | 2009-12-**25** | Dec **24**, 2009 | -1 day |

**Pattern:** All dates consistently 1 day earlier than CSV input

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
```typescript
// In dancer.ts:577 (AFTER Bug #4 fix)
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00') : undefined,
```

The issue is likely timezone handling:
1. CSV date: `"2010-05-15"` (no timezone)
2. Server creates: `new Date("2010-05-15T00:00:00")` (assumes local timezone)
3. Database stores in UTC (may shift by timezone offset)
4. UI displays in local timezone (shifts back, causing -1 day)

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// OPTION 1: Force UTC
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00Z') : undefined,
// The 'Z' suffix forces UTC interpretation

// OPTION 2: Use date-only type (Prisma @db.Date)
// Already using @db.Date in schema, but DateTime conversion may cause issue
```

**Business Impact:**
- Age group calculations may be incorrect (off by 1 day)
- Dancer ages displayed incorrectly
- Could affect competition eligibility

**Recommendation:** Fix before launch (P1 priority)

## Bug Status After Session 2

### ‚úÖ Bug #4: Date String Prisma Error - FIXED & VERIFIED
**Original Issue:** Date strings passed to Prisma without Date() wrapper
**Fix Applied:** `dancer.ts:577` - Wrap date in `new Date()`
**Verification:** 3 tests confirm fix working
- Test 1.1: 5/5 dancers imported with dates ‚úÖ
- Test 1.2: 5/5 dancers imported with dates ‚úÖ
- Test 2.1: 1 dancer created with date ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED

---

### ‚úÖ Bug #5: Competition.getAll 500 Error - FIXED & VERIFIED
**Original Issue:** Query referenced non-existent `deleted_at` column
**Fix Applied:** `competition.ts:84` - Removed `where.deleted_at = null`
**Verification:** 1 test confirms fix working
- Test 3.1: Competition dropdown loads 3 competitions ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Bug #1: Date Timezone Offset - CONFIRMED (P1)
**Issue:** Dates displayed 1 day earlier than CSV/manual input
**Status:** STILL EXISTS after Bug #4 fix
**Severity:** P1 (High Priority - Recommended Pre-Launch Fix)

**Evidence from 11 Dancers Total:**

| Dancer Name | Input Date | UI Display | Offset |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Emma Johnson | 2010-05-**15** | May **14**, 2010 | -1 day |
| Michael Smith | 2008-03-**22** | Mar **21**, 2008 | -1 day |
| Sophia Williams | 2011-11-**08** | Nov **7**, 2011 | -1 day |
| James Brown | 2011-07-**08** | Jul **7**, 2011 | -1 day |
| Olivia Davis | 2009-12-**25** | Dec **24**, 2009 | -1 day |
| Sarah Test | 2013-06-**20** | Jun **19**, 2013 | -1 day |
| (5 more from Test 1.2) | Various | All -1 day | -1 day |

**Pattern:** 100% consistent -1 day offset across CSV import AND manual entry

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// Current code in dancer.ts:577
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00') : undefined,
// Missing 'Z' suffix causes local timezone interpretation
// Database stores UTC, UI displays local timezone ‚Üí -1 day shift
```

**Required Fix (1 line):**
```typescript
// Add 'Z' to force UTC interpretation:
date_of_birth: date_of_birth ? new Date(date_of_birth + 'T00:00:00Z') : undefined,
```

**Data Migration Required:**
```sql
-- Correct existing birthdates (add 1 day to all 17 dancers)
UPDATE dancers
SET date_of_birth = date_of_birth + INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL
  AND tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
```

**Business Impact:**
- Age calculations off by 1 day (could affect eligibility)
- User confusion about incorrect birthdates
- Potential competition rule violations

**Recommendation:** Fix before launch OR within 24 hours of launch

---

### ‚ùì Bug #2: 4/5 Success Rate - CANNOT VERIFY
**Status:** Not reproduced in Session 2
**Tests Executed:** All imports showed 100% success (5/5, 5/5, 1/1)
**Hypothesis:** May only occur with larger datasets (50+ dancers)

**Recommendation:** Monitor production imports for partial failures

---

### ‚úÖ Bug #3: Vague Error Messages - NOT APPLICABLE
**Status:** Not observed in Session 2
**Finding:** All error messages were detailed and specific
**Example:** Prisma errors showed exact field and validation issue

---

## New Findings from Session 2

### Finding #1: Capacity Validation - NO BLOCKING
**Test 3.2 Result:** System accepted 500 routine reservation without validation
**Expected:** Some limit or warning for excessive requests
**Actual:** Reservation created successfully, status=pending

**Implications:**
- Studios can request unlimited routines
- CD must manually review/adjust capacity
- No client-side validation preventing unreasonable requests

**Risk Level:** LOW (CD approval required, can adjust during approval)

**Recommendation:** Consider adding soft warning for >100 routines

---

### Finding #2: Multiple Reservations Allowed
**Test 3.3 Result:** Studio can submit multiple reservations for same competition
**Actual Behavior:** 2 reservations created for "St. Catharines #1" (5 and 500 routines)

**Implications:**
- Studios can submit incremental requests
- Studios can hedge capacity needs
- CD must manage multiple pending requests per studio

**Risk Level:** LOW (appears to be intentional design)

**Business Logic:** Likely allows studios to add more routines as they finalize numbers

---

### Finding #3: Status Filter Working Correctly
**Test 3.8 Result:** "Pending" filter button correctly shows only pending reservations
**UI Behavior:** Button highlights when active, shows count badge (3)

**Recommendation:** Competition dropdown filter not fully tested (visual dropdown not visible in automation)

---

## Database State After Session 2

### Dancers Created: 17 Total
**Previous Session (6 dancers):**
- Alice Cooper, Bob Dylan, Charlie Parker, Diana Ross, Eve Martinez

## Test Execution Tips

### Efficiency
- ‚úÖ Use Bash to create SQL query templates with placeholders
- ‚úÖ Take screenshots only at completion points
- ‚úÖ Copy/paste SQL queries from runbook, edit IDs as needed
- ‚úÖ Document blockers immediately (don't skip tests)

### Accuracy
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify via database, not just UI
- ‚úÖ Compare expected vs. actual explicitly
- ‚úÖ Note timestamp before each test for filtering queries
- ‚úÖ Use LIMIT in queries to reduce noise

### Organization
- ‚úÖ Create report file at start, fill as you go
- ‚úÖ Track time per category
- ‚úÖ Mark tests as PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED in real-time
- ‚úÖ Save all screenshots with naming convention: `test_{N}_{STATUS}.png`

---
