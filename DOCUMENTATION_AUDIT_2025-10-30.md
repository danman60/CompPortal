# Documentation Audit Report
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude (Overnight Launch Readiness)

---

## Executive Summary

**Status:** üü¢ GOOD - Critical business logic well-documented
- ‚úÖ Capacity service thoroughly documented
- ‚úÖ Business rule validators documented
- ‚úÖ Spec references throughout codebase
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some routers need inline comment improvements

---

## Well-Documented Files (Examples to Follow)

### ‚úÖ capacity.ts (Lines 1-334)
**Excellent documentation:**
- Class-level JSDoc explaining purpose
- Method-level JSDoc with @throws tags
- Inline comments for critical sections
- Spec references (Phase 1 spec lines 50-68, 589-651)
- Detailed logging for debugging

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Single source of truth for competition capacity management
 * All capacity changes MUST go through this service
 *
 * Matches Phase 1 spec lines 50-68 (capacity formula)
 * Implements atomic transactions with audit trail
 */
export class CapacityService {
  /**
   * Reserve capacity (decrement available)
   * Uses database row locking to prevent race conditions
   *
   * @throws InsufficientCapacityError if not enough capacity
   * @throws Error if reservation already processed
   */
  async reserve(...) { ... }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ entry.ts submitSummary (Lines 154-537)
**Good inline documentation:**
- Explains Phase 1 spec compliance
- Documents business rules inline
- Explains transaction boundaries
- Includes verification logic

**Example comments:**
```typescript
// First find the reservation to filter entries by reservation_id (per PHASE1_SPEC.md line 602)
// üêõ FIX Bug #3: Validate that there are entries to submit
// Matches Phase 1 spec lines 589-651 (capacity refund on summary submission)
// POST-TRANSACTION VERIFICATION - Catch "success response but no database change" paradox
```

---

### ‚úÖ reservation.ts approve (Lines 639-821)
**Solid business logic documentation:**
- Guard pattern explained (üõ°Ô∏è GUARD)
- Atomic operations marked (‚ö° ATOMIC)
- Spec references (Phase 1 spec lines 442-499)
- Email flow logging

---

## Files Needing Documentation Improvements

### üü° Medium Priority

#### competition.ts (publicProcedures)
**Issue:** Administrative mutations (create, update, cancel) lack:
- Permission requirements documentation
- Business rule explanations
- Side effect warnings

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
/**
 * Create new competition
 *
 * @permission competition_director or super_admin only
 * @sideEffect Creates default age groups, categories, classifications
 * @validation Requires valid tenant_id in context
 */
create: protectedProcedure
  .input(competitionInputSchema)
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
```

---

#### lookup.ts (Reference data)
**Issue:** Unclear if data is tenant-specific or global

**Recommendation:** Add comments explaining tenant scoping:
```typescript
/**
 * Get all dance categories
 *
 * @returns Tenant-scoped categories (filtered by ctx.tenantId)
 * @note Categories are tenant-specific - each tenant configures their own
 */
getCategories: publicProcedure.query(async () => {
```

---

#### analytics.ts (Business intelligence)
**Issue:** No documentation on data privacy or aggregation

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
/**
 * Get revenue statistics for competitions
 *
 * @permission competition_director or super_admin
 * @privacy Returns aggregated data only (no PII)
 * @performance Cached for 1 hour (see redis TTL)
 */
getRevenueStats: publicProcedure
```

---

## Documentation Standards (Recommended)

### For tRPC Procedures

```typescript
/**
 * [Brief description of what the procedure does]
 *
 * @permission [Required role(s)]
 * @param [Key parameters and their purpose]
 * @returns [What data is returned]
 * @throws [Common error conditions]
 * @sideEffect [Any side effects - emails, capacity changes, etc.]
 * @spec [Phase 1 spec line references if applicable]
 * @validation [Business rules enforced]
 */
```

### For Business Logic Functions

```typescript
/**
 * [Purpose of function]
 *
 * @param paramName - [Description]
 * @returns [What is returned]
 * @throws [Error conditions]
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * validateReservationCapacity(compId, studioId, 100);
 * ```
 */
```

### For Complex Inline Logic

```typescript
// üîí ATOMIC GUARD: Use PostgreSQL advisory lock
// This locks at APPLICATION LEVEL and is guaranteed to work across the transaction
// Lock is automatically released when transaction commits/rollbacks
await tx.$executeRaw`SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(${reservationId}::text))`;
```

## Comment Symbols (Already in Use)

**Current conventions found in codebase:**
- `üîê` - Security/permissions check
- `üõ°Ô∏è` - Guard/validation
- `‚ö°` - Atomic operation
- `üêõ` - Bug fix
- `üìù` - TODO/Note
- `‚úÖ` - Verification/success
- `‚ùå` - Failure/error

**Keep using these** - they make code scanning easier!

## Spec References Audit

### Files with Good Spec References

‚úÖ **entry.ts**
- Line 121: "matches submitSummary logic at line 151"
- Line 136: "matches submitSummary at line 171"
- Line 602: "per PHASE1_SPEC.md line 602"
- Line 599-651: "Matches Phase 1 spec lines 589-651"

‚úÖ **capacity.ts**
- Line 14: "Matches Phase 1 spec lines 50-68"
- Line 172: "Matches Phase 1 spec lines 589-651"

‚úÖ **reservation.ts**
- Line 676: "Matches Phase 1 spec lines 442-499"

---

## Undocumented Business Logic (Needs Comments)

### High Priority

1. **reservation.ts - reduceCapacity (Lines 1380-1472)**
   - Complex routine impact warning logic
   - Needs explanation of confirmation flow
   - Add spec reference if exists

2. **entry.ts - bulkImport (Lines 547-599)**
   - Default value logic unclear
   - Error handling could be explained
   - Add tenant scoping note

3. **studio.ts - invite flows**
   - Email triggering logic
   - Permission model
   - Subdomain generation

### Medium Priority

4. **invoice.ts - generation logic**
   - Fee calculation steps
   - Tax/discount application
   - Status transitions

5. **scoring.ts - judge assignment**
   - Scoring algorithm
   - Tie-breaking rules
   - Overall calculation

---

## Recommendations

### Before Launch (P0)

1. **Add missing JSDoc to publicProcedure mutations**
   - Explain why they're public vs protected
   - Document permission requirements
   - Warn about side effects

2. **Document email trigger points**
   - When emails are sent
   - What data is included
   - How preferences are checked

### Week 1 (P1)

1. **Add JSDoc to all exported functions**
   - Use standard template above
   - Include @example for complex functions
   - Link to spec sections where applicable

2. **Document complex business rules**
   - Age group auto-detection
   - Entry size category rules
   - Late fee calculation

3. **Create inline flowcharts for state machines**
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Reservation Status Flow:
    * pending ‚Üí approved ‚Üí summarized ‚Üí invoiced ‚Üí closed
    *               ‚Üì
    *           rejected
    */
   ```

### Long-Term (P2)

1. **Generate API documentation from JSDoc**
   - Use TypeDoc or similar
   - Publish for Competition Directors
   - Include permission matrix

2. **Add architecture decision records (ADRs)**
   - Why capacity uses advisory locks
   - Why dual-write was abandoned
   - Why certain publicProcedures exist
