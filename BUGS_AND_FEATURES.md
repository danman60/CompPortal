## üé¨ At Competition Mode (Future Major Feature)

### Overview
At Competition Mode is a dedicated live-operation screen used during events.
Synchronizes all active routines, judges' tablets, and RTMP broadcast overlay in real time.

### üñ•Ô∏è Screen Layout

#### Left Panel ‚Äì Routine List
- Displays all routines in running order
- Active routine highlighted
- Upcoming routines and scheduled breaks clearly indicated

#### Bottom Panel ‚Äì Judge Sync & Scores
- Shows each judge's live scores for current routine
- Real-time score display as judges submit
- Score aggregation and validation

#### Top Controls ‚Äì Playback & Navigation
- Playlist-style buttons (‚ñ∂ Next, ‚è∏ Pause, ‚èÆ Back)
- Competition director can advance or rewind routines
- "Next Routine" button updates all connected judges' tablets automatically

#### Right Panel ‚Äì Routine Notes
- Live note entry for current routine
- Examples: prop issues, timing, judging anomalies
- Notes saved to specific routine record

### üîÑ Real-Time Synchronization

When competition director presses **Next**:
1. Marks new routine as "Current" across all devices
2. Sends routine context to each judge's tablet (no manual advance)
3. Locks all judges' scoring forms to current routine ID
4. Judges' tablets automatically refresh with:
   - Routine title
   - Studio name
   - Dancer list

### üß† Intelligent Behavior
- Automatically detects/displays upcoming breaks, awards blocks, intermissions
- Clear visual timers between routines (stage management pacing)
- Offline caching for brief network interruptions
- Conflict detection and warnings

### üì° RTMP Overlay Integration

Real-time routine data feeds directly into RTMP overlay system, updating:
- Routine title and number
- Studio name
- Dancer(s) names
- Category or division

**Result**: Livestream overlays always display correct routine without manual intervention

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] WebSocket server for real-time sync
- [ ] Judge tablet responsive interface
- [ ] RTMP overlay API integration
- [ ] Offline mode with sync queue
- [ ] Competition director control panel
- [ ] Routine state machine (queued ‚Üí current ‚Üí completed)
- [ ] Multi-judge score aggregation
- [ ] Break/intermission scheduling system
- [ ] Live notes database schema
- [ ] Mobile-first judge tablet UI

### User Stories
- **As a Competition Director**, I want to advance routines from one control panel so all judges stay synchronized
- **As a Judge**, I want my tablet to automatically show the current routine so I don't have to manually navigate
- **As a Livestream Operator**, I want overlays to update automatically so I don't miss routine information
- **As a Stage Manager**, I want visual timers between routines so I can pace the event properly
- **As a Competition Director**, I want to add live notes during routines so I can reference them later

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic routine state management and navigation
2. **Phase 2**: Judge tablet sync via WebSockets
3. **Phase 3**: RTMP overlay integration
4. **Phase 4**: Offline mode and conflict resolution
5. **Phase 5**: Break scheduling and timer system
6. **Phase 6**: Live notes and anomaly tracking
