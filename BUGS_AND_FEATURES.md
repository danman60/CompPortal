## üéØ Planned Features (Roadmap)

### 1. Entry Numbering & Sub-Entry Logic
- **Priority**: üü° High (Core scheduling feature)
- **Feature ID**: FEAT-EntryNumbering
- **Scheduled For**: Phase 4, Week 13 (Schedule Generation)
- **Status**: ‚è≥ PLANNED

#### Feature Description
**Industry-standard entry numbering system for competition scheduling**

**Entry Numbers:**
- Public-facing three-digit numbers begin at **100** (industry standard)
- Scoped per competition weekend (CompID) - each competition resets to 100
- Assigned during schedule generation by Competition Director
- Once assigned, entry numbers never change (locked after schedule published)
- Backend uses UUIDs for internal operations (never shown to users)

**Sub-Entries (Letter Suffixes):**
- Late additions manually designated by Competition Director
- Assigned as sub-entries with letter suffixes: `156a`, `156b`, `156c`
- Preserves numbering continuity without renumbering existing entries
- Appears in all dashboards, reports, PDFs, and judges' sheets

**Schedule Workflow:**
1. Studio Directors create entries (DRAFT) and assign dancers/categories/music
2. Competition Director runs "Generate Schedule" (auto-assigns times + entry numbers starting at 100)
3. Schedule published ‚Üí entry numbers locked
4. Late entries ‚Üí CD manually inserts with suffix (e.g., picks entry 156, adds 156a)

**Role Permissions:**
- **Competition Director**: Generate schedule, assign entry numbers, designate late entries with suffixes
- **Studio Director**: View assigned entry numbers (read-only), see scheduled times

#### Technical Implementation

**Database Schema Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE competition_entries ADD COLUMN entry_number INT NULL;
ALTER TABLE competition_entries ADD COLUMN entry_suffix VARCHAR(5) NULL;
ALTER TABLE competition_entries ADD COLUMN scheduled_time TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE competition_entries ADD COLUMN is_late_entry BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Unique constraint: entry_number + suffix must be unique per competition
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_entry_number_per_comp
ON competition_entries(competition_id, entry_number, COALESCE(entry_suffix, ''));
```

**Display Logic:**
- Combined format: `entry_number` + `entry_suffix` (e.g., "156" or "156a")
- Shown in: Entry lists, schedule views, scorecards, exports, PDFs

**Studio Director Dashboard:**
For each entry, display:
- Entry Number (e.g., 156a) - once scheduled
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Dancers Assigned
- Category
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Music Uploaded
- Scheduled Time (e.g., "Saturday 2:30 PM")
- Sortable/filterable table

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Migration: `prisma/migrations/add_entry_numbering.sql`
- Schema: Update `prisma/schema.prisma` (competition_entries model)
- Backend: Update `src/server/routers/entry.ts` (add numbering logic)
- Backend: Create `src/server/routers/schedule.ts` (new router for scheduling)
- Frontend: Update `src/components/EntriesList.tsx` (show entry numbers)
- Frontend: Create `src/app/dashboard/scheduling/page.tsx` (CD scheduling UI)
- Types: Update generated Prisma types

**Related Features:**
- Requires Schedule Generation system (Phase 4, Week 13)
- Integrates with PDF export (Phase 4, Week 14)
- Affects Entry Management (Phase 3, Week 11)

### 2. Real-Time Scoring & Tabulation System
- **Priority**: üî¥ Critical (Competition Day Operations)
- **Feature ID**: FEAT-RealtimeScoring
- **Scheduled For**: Phase 4, Week 14 (Real-Time Scoring & Export System)
- **Status**: ‚è≥ PLANNED

#### Feature Description
**Industry-standard real-time scoring system for competition day adjudication and live results**

**Judge Scoring Interface:**
- **Slider-based input** for each criterion (1-100 points):
  - Technique
  - Artistic/Performance
  - Musicality
  - Additional criteria (execution, choreography) as configured by CD
- **Entry number displayed** prominently for judge reference
- **Submit score** button triggers real-time processing

**Real-Time Calculation Engine:**
- **Immediate calculation** upon judge score submission (sub-second latency)
- **Average score** across all judges (typically 3 judges per panel)
- **Auto-categorization into award levels**:
  - Example: Platinum (90-100), High Gold (85-89.9), Gold (80-84.9), Silver (70-79.9)
  - CD defines exact ranges per competition (stored in database)
- **Category placements** calculated automatically (1st, 2nd, 3rd within age/category/level)
- **Tie-break rules** applied automatically:
  - Highest technique score wins
  - If tied, highest artistic score
  - If still tied, judges' discretion or shared placement

**Live Scoreboard:**
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
- **Displays**:
  - Entry number (e.g., 156, 156a)
  - Routine title
  - Studio name
  - Current average score
  - Award level (Platinum, Gold, Silver)
  - Category placement (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Auto-refresh** without manual page reload
- **Accessible to**:
  - Competition Director (always)
  - Optional: Public scoreboard (CD configurable)
  - Optional: Studio directors (view their own entries only)

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Sub-second latency**: Score submission ‚Üí scoreboard update
- **Concurrent scoring**: Handle 3+ judges scoring simultaneously
- **High throughput**: 10+ entries per hour during peak competition
- **Database optimization**: Indexed queries, triggers for auto-calculation
- **Caching**: Redis or similar for leaderboard queries (if needed)

#### Technical Implementation

**Database Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- Competition-level award configuration
ALTER TABLE competitions ADD COLUMN scoring_ranges JSONB;
-- Example: {"platinum": [90, 100], "high_gold": [85, 89.9], "gold": [80, 84.9], "silver": [70, 79.9]}

-- Entry-level calculated fields
ALTER TABLE competition_entries ADD COLUMN calculated_score DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE competition_entries ADD COLUMN award_level VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE competition_entries ADD COLUMN category_placement INT;

-- Real-time indexing for judges_scores
CREATE INDEX idx_scores_realtime ON judges_scores(entry_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_scores_by_judge ON judges_scores(judge_id, entry_id);
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/scoring/submit` - Judge submits score (triggers real-time processing)
- `GET /api/scoring/leaderboard/:competitionId` - Current standings
- WebSocket: `/ws/scoring/:competitionId` - Real-time updates subscription

**Real-Time Update Flow:**
1. Judge submits score via slider interface
2. Score saved to `judges_scores` table
3. Database trigger calculates:
   - Average score for this entry (across all judges who have scored)
   - Award level (based on competition's scoring_ranges)
   - Category placement (re-sort all entries in same category)
4. Updated values saved to `competition_entries` table
5. WebSocket broadcast to all connected clients (scoreboard, CD dashboard)
6. Scoreboard UI updates instantly

**Competition Director Controls:**
- Define award level ranges at competition creation/edit
- Configure tie-break rules (technique priority, artistic fallback)
- Enable/disable public scoreboard visibility
- Manually adjust scores (override for errors/disputes)

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Backend: `src/server/routers/scoring.ts` (enhanced for real-time)
- Backend: `src/lib/websocket.ts` (WebSocket server setup)
- Backend: Database triggers for auto-calculation
- Frontend: `src/app/dashboard/scoring/page.tsx` (judge interface with sliders)
- Frontend: `src/app/dashboard/scoreboard/page.tsx` (enhanced for real-time)
- Frontend: `src/components/LiveScoreboard.tsx` (WebSocket client)
- Frontend: `src/hooks/useRealtimeScores.ts` (WebSocket hook)

**Related Features:**
- Requires Entry Numbering system (Phase 4, Week 13)
- Integrates with Judge Management (Phase 3, Week 11)
- Outputs to PDF/CSV exports (Phase 4, Week 14)
- Feeds Analytics Dashboard (Phase 4, Week 15)

**User Stories:**
- As a **Judge**, I can score routines using sliders and see my scores submit instantly
- As a **Competition Director**, I can view real-time standings during competition and adjust award level ranges
- As a **Studio Director**, I can see my entries' scores and award levels update live (optional feature)
- As a **Stage Manager**, I can reference entry numbers on the scoreboard to call routines
