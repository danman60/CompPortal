## Key Findings

### ✅ RBAC Validation Success
**Multi-tenancy is working correctly**:
- Studio Directors see ONLY their own studio's data (0 dancers for Demo Dance Studio)
- Competition Directors see ALL data across all studios (15 dancers total)
- No multi-tenancy leaks detected in READ operations

### ⚠️ Issues to Fix
1. **Sign Out HTTP 405**: Critical UX issue preventing proper logout
2. **CREATE operations untested**: Need to test data creation after fixing sign out bug
