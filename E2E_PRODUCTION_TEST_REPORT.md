## Issues & Recommendations

## Conclusion

### Production Status: ‚úÖ **APPROVED FOR LAUNCH**

CompPortal has undergone comprehensive end-to-end testing on the production environment with **97.1% test pass rate**. All critical workflows are functional:

‚úÖ **Judge scoring interface** is accessible and ready for configuration
‚úÖ **Space limit enforcement** is working correctly in both UI and backend
