| URL | Error | Design Issue | Status |
|-----|-------|--------------|--------|

## Summary

- **Tests Run**: 22
- **Bugs Found**: 5
- **Bugs Fixed**: 3 fully verified
- **Bugs Partially Fixed**: 1 (invoices/all - needs additional work)
- **Not Bugs**: 1 (user error)

## Outstanding Issues

### Invoices/All Page (Priority: Medium)
**Status**: Partial fix applied
**Issue**: Page converted to client component (26f8e76) which resolved immediate SSR crash, but React #310 error still occurs during component render.
**Next Steps**:
1. Investigate AllInvoicesList component for hooks ordering issues
2. Check getAllInvoices tRPC endpoint for async/await issues
3. Verify tRPC query configuration in component
4. Test with actual invoice data (currently no invoices exist)
