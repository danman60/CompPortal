## Integrate Welcome Email Template – Result

Status: ✅ Complete

File Modified
- src/server/routers/studio.ts
  - Added imports: `WelcomeEmail` and `render` from `@react-email/render`
  - In `approve` mutation, after approval email, send WelcomeEmail to studio owner
  - Wrapped in try/catch to avoid blocking approval on email failures

Email Sender Pattern
- Custom `sendEmail` helper (`src/lib/email.ts`) with pre‑rendered HTML (using `@react-email/render`)

Email Address Source
- `studio.users_studios_owner_idTousers.email` (owner user record); owner name from `user_profiles`

Test Notes
- Approval flow continues if email fails (console error only)
- Logs still indicate primary approval email and welcome email sends

Build
- Global build remains blocked by unrelated `@hookform/resolvers/zod` import in `src/components/ProfileSettingsForm.tsx`.
