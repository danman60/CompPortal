# STATUS: 01_tenant_schema

Date: 2025-10-10
State: completed (schema already multi-tenant; seed + assign prepared)

Summary
- Found task `01_tenant_schema.md`.
- Inspected `prisma/schema.prisma`: `tenants` model exists; `tenant_id` already present with FK/indexes on required tables.
- Created migration SQL to seed `demo` and `empwr` tenants and assign competitions by name pattern.
- Wrote output file with full SQL and validation checklist.

Artifacts
- Migration: `codex-tasks/migrations/20251010_seed_tenants_and_assign.sql`
- Output: `codex-tasks/outputs/01_tenant_schema_result.md`

Next Steps
- Optional: Confirm whether to also modify Prisma schema (request conflicts with `.codexrc`). If confirmed, I can update `prisma/schema.prisma` accordingly.
