# QUESTION: New Task Request

Date: 2025-10-10

Context:
- On "continue", I checked `codex-tasks/questions/`, `codex-tasks/answers/`, and `codex-tasks/*.md`.
- No actionable task files were found (only docs and an example task).

Request:
- Please provide the next task as `codex-tasks/[TASK_NAME].md` with requirements and file paths per the project patterns.

Notes:
- I will monitor `answers/` and `tasks/` on subsequent "continue" and proceed immediately once the task arrives.
