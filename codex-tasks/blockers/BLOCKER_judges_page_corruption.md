# BLOCKER: Judges Page File Corruption [RESOLVED]

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED in commit 8eeac22
**Resolved by**: Codex

## Original Issue
`src/app/dashboard/judges/page.tsx` had file corruption with duplicate JSX fragments and binary characters.

## Resolution
All issues fixed in commit 8eeac22:
- ✅ Removed duplicate content (lines 1-14)
- ✅ Added JudgeBulkImportModal import
- ✅ Added showBulkImportModal state
- ✅ Fixed corrupted emoji characters
- ✅ Build passes (41 routes)

## Verification
```bash
$ grep -n "JudgeBulkImportModal" src/app/dashboard/judges/page.tsx
5:import JudgeBulkImportModal from '@/components/JudgeBulkImportModal';
540:        <JudgeBulkImportModal

$ head -12 src/app/dashboard/judges/page.tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { trpc } from '@/lib/trpc';
import JudgeBulkImportModal from '@/components/JudgeBulkImportModal';

export default function JudgesPage() {
  const [selectedCompetition, setSelectedCompetition] = useState<string>('');
  const [showAddModal, setShowAddModal] = useState(false);
  const [showEditModal, setShowEditModal] = useState(false);
  const [editingJudge, setEditingJudge] = useState<any>(null);
  const [showBulkImportModal, setShowBulkImportModal] = useState(false);
```

**Status**: No action needed. File is clean and working.
