---

### Iteration 5: Schema Analysis & Data Migration Strategy ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Schema kept optional for backwards compatibility

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Checked existing data for NULL values
  - 110 dancers without classification_id
  - 13 dancers without date_of_birth
  - 1 entry without choreographer
- ‚úÖ Evaluated NOT NULL constraint feasibility

**Decision: Keep Fields Optional in Schema**
- **Rationale**: Production system with real data cannot enforce NOT NULL without data migration
- **Strategy**: New data enforced via frontend + backend validation
- **Impact**: Existing 110+ dancers can continue to exist, new dancers must have classification
- **Benefits**: No breaking changes, gradual migration possible
- **Frontend**: Already requires fields for new submissions ‚úÖ
- **Backend**: Already validates new submissions ‚úÖ
- **Schema**: Remains permissive for existing data ‚úÖ

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
1. ‚ùå Force NOT NULL + backfill with defaults (bad: loses data integrity)
2. ‚ùå Delete incomplete records (bad: destroys user data)
3. ‚úÖ **Chosen**: Gradual migration via UI enforcement (safe, reversible)

**Production Impact:**
- Zero breaking changes
- Existing functionality preserved
- New submissions validated
- Data integrity maintained

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor new submissions (should all have required fields)
- CSV import updates to require classification
- Production testing on both tenants

## üö® Blockers

### Active Blockers

**BLOCKER 1: Phase 2 Entry Form Changes Applied to Wrong Component**
- **Severity:** P1 (HIGH) - Blocks Phase 2 launch
- **Discovered:** October 31, 2025 05:45 (Test Run 2)
- **Impact:** Extended time functionality completely missing from production entry form
- **Root Cause:** Iteration 3 updated UnifiedRoutineForm.tsx (legacy component) instead of EntryCreateFormV2.tsx (active component)
- **Missing Features:**
  - Choreographer field not marked as required (shows "optional")
  - Extended time checkbox missing
  - Routine length inputs (minutes/seconds) missing
  - Scheduling notes textarea missing
- **Required Fix:** Apply all Iteration 3 changes to EntryCreateFormV2.tsx
- **Files Affected:**
  - src/components/rebuild/entries/EntryCreateFormV2.tsx (needs Phase 2 UI)
  - src/hooks/rebuild/useEntryFormV2.ts (needs extended time state)
- **Evidence:** Screenshots empwr_entry_form_phase2_test_part1.png, part2.png, part3.png
