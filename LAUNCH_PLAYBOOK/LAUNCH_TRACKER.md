---

### Iteration 5: Schema Analysis & Data Migration Strategy ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Schema kept optional for backwards compatibility

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Checked existing data for NULL values
  - 110 dancers without classification_id
  - 13 dancers without date_of_birth
  - 1 entry without choreographer
- ‚úÖ Evaluated NOT NULL constraint feasibility

**Decision: Keep Fields Optional in Schema**
- **Rationale**: Production system with real data cannot enforce NOT NULL without data migration
- **Strategy**: New data enforced via frontend + backend validation
- **Impact**: Existing 110+ dancers can continue to exist, new dancers must have classification
- **Benefits**: No breaking changes, gradual migration possible
- **Frontend**: Already requires fields for new submissions ‚úÖ
- **Backend**: Already validates new submissions ‚úÖ
- **Schema**: Remains permissive for existing data ‚úÖ

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
1. ‚ùå Force NOT NULL + backfill with defaults (bad: loses data integrity)
2. ‚ùå Delete incomplete records (bad: destroys user data)
3. ‚úÖ **Chosen**: Gradual migration via UI enforcement (safe, reversible)

**Production Impact:**
- Zero breaking changes
- Existing functionality preserved
- New submissions validated
- Data integrity maintained

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor new submissions (should all have required fields)
- CSV import updates to require classification
- Production testing on both tenants
