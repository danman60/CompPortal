# BLOCKER: Reservation Not Closing After Summary Submission - IN PROGRESS

**Date:** October 25, 2025 16:30 UTC
**Status:** üîç **FIX #6 DEPLOYED - UI ISOLATION TEST**
**Impact:** Phase 1 workflow completely broken - reservations never close, capacity never refunded

## Root Cause Analysis

### Fix #4 Theory: `logActivity()` Transaction Mixing

At entry.ts:372, `logActivity()` was called INSIDE the `prisma.$transaction()` block. The `logActivity()` function uses `prisma.$executeRaw` with the global `prisma` instance, which **cannot participate in the transaction context**.

**Status:** ‚ùå Fix #4 deployed but error persists - indicates additional issues exist

### Fix #5: Enhanced Debugging & Verification

Based on FRESH_DEBUGGING_INSIGHTS.md, implemented comprehensive logging:
- Transaction START/END/COMMITTED markers (entry.ts:245-252, 379-395)
- Post-transaction verification to detect paradox (entry.ts:397-426)
- Explicit timeout/maxWait configuration (entry.ts:387-390)
- Immediate error if DB state doesn't match expected

**Purpose:** Identify exact failure point - transaction completion vs. commit vs. rollback

## All Fixes Applied

### Fix #1 (Commit bf54ce8) - Inline Capacity Refund
**Issue:** Nested transaction - capacityService.refund() started its own transaction
**Fix:** Inlined all capacity logic within submitSummary transaction
**Result:** ‚ùå Still failing - but eliminated one issue

### Fix #2 (Commit b969e51) - Scope getSummary to Reservation
**Issue:** getSummary counted all entries, submitSummary only processed one reservation
**Fix:** Changed getSummary to find approved reservation first, filter entries by reservation_id
**Result:** ‚ùå Still failing - but fixed a data mismatch

### Fix #3 (Commit 5911723) - Expand Entry Select for Snapshot
**Issue:** Only selected `id` and `total_fee` but tried to snapshot full entry object
**Fix:** Expanded select to include all snapshot fields (19 fields), convert dates to ISO strings
**Result:** ‚ùå Still failing - but enabled proper snapshot creation

### Fix #4 (Commit 1c0c446) - Move logActivity Outside Transaction
**Issue:** `logActivity()` used global `prisma` instance inside transaction context
**Fix:** Moved `logActivity()` call outside transaction block with try/catch
**Result:** ‚ùå **STILL FAILING** - Error persists despite fix
**Code Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (line 372 - INSIDE transaction)
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // ... all operations ...

  await logActivity({  // ‚Üê Uses global prisma, breaks transaction!
    userId: ctx.userId,
    action: 'summary.submitted',
    // ...
  });
});

// AFTER (line 375 - OUTSIDE transaction)
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // ... all operations ...
});

// Activity logging moved outside (non-blocking)
try {
  await logActivity({
    userId: ctx.userId,
    action: 'summary.submitted',
    // ...
  });
} catch (logError) {
  logger.error('Failed to log summary submission activity', { error: logError });
}
```

### Fix #5 (Commit cee8265) - Enhanced Transaction Logging & Verification
**Issue:** Need to identify exact failure point in transaction lifecycle
**Fix:** Added comprehensive logging and post-transaction verification per FRESH_DEBUGGING_INSIGHTS.md
**Changes:**
- Transaction START/END/COMMITTED log markers with timestamps
- Post-transaction DB verification query
- Throws TRANSACTION_PARADOX error if DB doesn't match expected state
- Explicit transaction timeout (10s) and maxWait (5s) config

**Expected Result:** Logs will reveal exact failure point - options:
1. See START but not END ‚Üí Transaction fails during execution
2. See END but not COMMITTED ‚Üí Transaction completes but doesn't commit
3. See COMMITTED but PARADOX error ‚Üí Transaction commits but changes don't persist
4. No PARADOX error ‚Üí Transaction works correctly

**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED** - Transaction logging added

### Fix #6 (Commit d22bbd9) - UI Isolation Test
**Theory:** Bottom submit button may be affected by live summary element interference
**Fix:** Added duplicate submit button in page header, isolated from bottom summary panel
**Changes:**
- New "Submit Summary" button in top row beside "Create Routine" (EntriesList.tsx:236-257)
- Same mutation logic: `submitSummaryMutation.mutate({ studioId, competitionId })`
- Visibility conditions: SD role + competition selected + entries exist
- Positioned away from potentially interfering live summary DOM

**Hypothesis:** If header button works but bottom button fails, confirms UI/React state interference
**Expected Result:** Either button triggers successful transaction with all database changes persisting

**Status:** üîç **DEPLOYED - AWAITING TEST WITH HEADER BUTTON**

## Why This Wasn't in Logs

The transaction rollback happens silently in Prisma when:
1. An operation inside the transaction uses a different client instance
2. The operation completes successfully but doesn't commit as part of the transaction
3. Prisma internally detects the inconsistency and rolls back
4. No exception is thrown to the application layer
5. The mutation returns success (201 OK) but database has no changes

This is a known Prisma behavior - all operations inside `$transaction(async (tx) => {...})` **MUST** use the `tx` client, not the global `prisma` instance.

## Expected Database State After Fix #4

After deployment and successful test:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM summaries;
-- Expected: 1 (or more)

SELECT status, is_closed FROM reservations
WHERE id = 'd6b7de60-b4f4-4ed8-99a7-b15864150b6d';
-- Expected: status='summarized', is_closed=true

SELECT available_reservation_tokens FROM competitions
WHERE id = '2121d20a-62fc-4aa3-a6aa-be9e7c4e140a';
-- Expected: 548 (525 + 23 refund)

SELECT status FROM competition_entries
WHERE id = '43c1db28-a405-4068-9f65-b6ca754d8fcc';
-- Expected: status='submitted'
```

## Next Steps - Debugging Protocol

### What to Look For in Logs

After testing Fix #5, check logs for these markers:

**Success Pattern (transaction works):**
```
üîÑ Transaction START - summary submission
‚úÖ Transaction END - about to commit
üíæ Transaction COMMITTED successfully
üîç POST-TRANSACTION VERIFICATION
   actual: { status: 'summarized', is_closed: true, ... }
   expected: { status: 'summarized', is_closed: true, ... }
```

**Failure Patterns:**

1. **Transaction fails during execution:**
   - See: `üîÑ Transaction START`
   - Missing: `‚úÖ Transaction END`
   - Indicates: Error thrown inside transaction block

2. **Transaction completes but doesn't commit:**
   - See: `üîÑ Transaction START` + `‚úÖ Transaction END`
   - Missing: `üíæ Transaction COMMITTED`
   - Indicates: Prisma rolling back between completion and commit

3. **Transaction commits but changes don't persist:**
   - See: All three markers + `üö® TRANSACTION PARADOX DETECTED`
   - Indicates: Database-level issue (trigger, constraint, race condition)

### Additional Debugging Strategies (If Fix #5 Fails)

From FRESH_DEBUGGING_INSIGHTS.md:

**Phase 2 - Deep Audit:**
- Check for Prisma middleware (may be intercepting transactions)
- Check for database triggers on reservations/summaries/competitions tables
- Verify no race conditions with state validation

**Phase 3 - Isolation Testing:**
- Test minimal transaction (update single field on reservation)
- If minimal test succeeds but full transaction fails ‚Üí Complex logic issue
- If minimal test fails ‚Üí Prisma client, database, or environment issue

**Phase 4 - Nuclear Options:**
- Regenerate Prisma client completely
- Try raw SQL transaction to isolate Prisma-specific issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never mix transaction clients** - All operations in `prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {...})` MUST use `tx`, not global `prisma`
2. **Move non-critical operations outside transactions** - Activity logging, emails, etc. should run after transaction commits
3. **Silent rollbacks are hard to debug** - Prisma doesn't always throw errors when transactions fail due to client mixing
4. **Check for `prisma.$executeRaw` in transactions** - Raw SQL operations need special attention in transaction contexts

## Impact

- **Phase 1 workflow:** Currently 0% functional ‚Üí Expected 100% after Fix #4
- **Production readiness:** ‚ùå BLOCKED ‚Üí ‚úÖ UNBLOCKED after verification
- **User confidence:** Lost ‚Üí To be restored with successful test

---

**RESOLUTION:** Fix #4 addresses the root cause. Transaction rollback was caused by mixing `prisma` and `tx` client instances.
